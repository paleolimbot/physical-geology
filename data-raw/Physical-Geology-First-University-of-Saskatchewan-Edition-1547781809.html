Adapting an open textbook is a far less daunting task than starting from scratch so I was excited to hear of the textbook <em><a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/find-open-textbooks/?uuid=52166cd1-e380-4e1b-9a6f-d891936e4749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physical Geology</a></em> by Steven Earle, written for the <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/find-open-textbooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BCcampus Open Textbook project</a>. Steven&#8217;s original edition was a comprehensive and solid foundation on which to build this adapted work.  Thanks to Amanda Coolidge of BCcampus for saving me an enormous amount of time by explaining how to modify the text and sending me the exported files from Steven’s version of the textbook.</p> <p>Many thanks go to Heather Ross and Nancy Turner at the Gwenna Moss Centre for their support and encouragement on this project and for discussions with them about open textbooks. The University of Saskatchewan Open Educational Resources Fund provided funding to support my work on this project. In-kind work and assistance on the project to match my time for this funding were provided by Joyce McBeth and Tim Prokopiuk of the Department of Geological Sciences.</p> <p>This book has benefited from the work of numerous contributors at the University of Saskatchewan who have assisted with editing the document and providing new images to include in this edition. Tim Prokopiuk contributed edits and selected rock samples for me to photograph from the department’s collection. Joyce McBeth provided numerous edits to this edition and adapted Chapters 14, 15, and 17. Lyndsay Hauber provided assistance with updates to image attributions for the chapter on plate tectonics. Donna Beneteau and Doug Milne of the College of Engineering, and Zoli Hajnal of Geological Sciences gave me a tour of the <a href="https://research.usask.ca/portalforindustry/facilities/geological-engineering-rock-mechanics-facility.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geological Engineering Rock Mechanics Facility</a>, and helped me to photograph their experiments.</p> <h1>Image Sources</h1> <p>This project would not be possible without the generosity of many individuals and organizations who shared their work with a Creative Commons license or under other open licensing terms. The following is a list of valuable image resources, as much as it is an acknowledgement of contributions:</p> <p><strong>Roger Weller</strong> has made available thousands of his <a href="http://skywalker.cochise.edu/wellerr/mineral/minlist.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-quality rock and mineral photographs</a> through his website hosted by Cochise College, and granted permission for their non-commercial educational use. His photos have been used extensively throughout this project. Roger&#8217;s usage stipulation has led to thoughtful discussions about what the appropriate way is to license derivative materials that make use of non Creative-Commons content. We have concluded that the best way to ensure that his wishes are respected is to license materials I make with his photographs as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC-SA</a>. This permits free sharing and remixing, but stipulates no commercial use, and that all derivative works must be shared with a non-commercial license.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jsjgeology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James St. John</a></strong> is a geologist and paleontologist who has contributed (at the time of this writing) more than 59,000 high-quality geology-related photographs to the photo-sharing website Flickr. His photographs cover a wide range of rocks and minerals, and rarely has there been an image that I needed but couldn&#8217;t find in his work. His Flickr account is remarkable for the abundance and quality of photographs, but also because he includes detailed descriptions of his images, making it possible for me to verify that an image is what I think it is, and gather useful background information. He has shared his images with a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY</a> license, which I appreciate greatly because it allows me to combine them with content having more restrictive licenses.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>U. S. Geological Survey</strong></a> has contributed innumerable images to the public domain. <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory</a> in particular is my go-to source for both the latest in volcano photos, and for fascinating historical images. Data and images from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Latest Earthquakes</a> map have been invaluable.</p> <p>I have used <strong><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA</a></strong> images for views of Earth as much as I have for views of space and other planets. It is truly remarkable that in spite of the vast resources and expertise needed to acquire these photographs, they are free to view, use, and learn from.</p> <p>Among the many teaching resources offered by <a href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>IRIS</strong></a> (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) are beautifully designed images for explaining earthquakes and seismology.</p> <p>When all other sources failed, the odds were good that <a href="https://uamineralmuseum.com/person/robert-lavinsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Lavinsky</a> (<a href="https://www.irocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.iRocks.com</a>), <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mikenorton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Norton</a>, or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Rygel,_M.C." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Rygel</a> had contributed exactly the right photograph to Wikimedia Commons.</p> </div></div>

Edits since the spring of 2017 were supported financially through the University of Saskatchewan&#8217;s Open Educational Resources Fund.</p> <p>Key aspects of this latest version include:</p> <ul><li>Expanded content on topics of particular importance to instructors at the University of Saskatchewan: Earth-system change, glaciation, and mass wasting</li> <li>Updated coverage of recent events and research;</li> <li>A consistent and transparent system for image attributions, making sources and permissions easy to trace.</li> <li>Additional images to support written content. The First University of Saskatchewan Edition contains approximately 580 figures, 40% of which were modified, added, or created as original works for this edition.</li> </ul> <p>Thus far, this textbook (including previous adapted versions we&#8217;ve prepared) has been used by nearly a thousand students at the University of Saskatchewan, saving them tens of thousands of dollars in textbook costs.

<div class="front-matter miscellaneous" id="front-matter-preface-to-the-original-edition" title="Preface to the Original Edition"><div class="front-matter-title-wrap"><h3 class="front-matter-number">5</h3><h1 class="front-matter-title">Preface to the Original Edition</h1></div><div class="ugc front-matter-ugc"><p>This book was born out of a 2014 meeting of earth science educators representing most of the universities and colleges in British Columbia, and nurtured by a widely shared frustration that many students are not thriving in our courses because textbooks have become too expensive for them to buy. But the real inspiration comes from a fascination for the spectacular geology of western Canada and the many decades that I have spent exploring this region along with colleagues, students, family, and friends. My goal has been to provide an accessible and comprehensive guide to the important topics of geology, richly illustrated with examples from western Canada. Although this text is intended to complement a typical first-year course in physical geology, its contents could be applied to numerous other related courses.</p> <p>As a teacher for many years, and as someone who is constantly striving to discover new things, I am well aware of that people learn in myriad ways, and that for most, simply reading the contents of a book is not one of the most effective ones. For that reason, this book includes numerous embedded exercises and activities that are designed to encourage readers to engage with the concepts presented, and to make meaning of the material under consideration. It is strongly recommended that you try the exercises as you progress through each chapter. You should also find it useful, whether or not assigned by your instructor, to complete the questions at the end of each chapter.</p> <p>Over many years of teaching earth science I have received a lot of feedback from students. What gives me the most pleasure is to hear that someone, having completed my course, now sees Earth with new eyes, and has discovered both the thrill and the value of an enhanced understanding of how our planet works.

They study the changes that have occurred over the vast time-span of Earth&#8217;s history, and changes that might take place in the near future.</p> <p>Geology is a science, meaning that geological questions are investigated with deductive reasoning and scientific methodology. Geology is arguably the most interdisciplinary of all of the sciences because geologists must understand and apply other sciences, including physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and more.</p> <p>An aspect of geology that is unlike most of the other sciences is the role played by time — deep time — billions of years of it. When geologists study the evidence around them, they are often observing the results of are observing the results of events that took place thousands, millions, and even billions of years in the past, and which may still be ongoing. Many geological processes happen at incredibly slow rates — millimetres per year to centimetres per year — but because of the amount of time available, tiny changes can result in expansive oceans forming, or entire mountain ranges being worn away.</p> <div class="textbox"><h4>Geology on a Grand Scale in the Canadian Rocky Mountains</h4> <p>The peak on the right of the photographs in Figure 11.2 is Rearguard Mountain, which is a few kilometres northeast of Mount Robson. Mount Robson is the tallest peak in the Canadian Rockies, at 3,954 m. The large glacier in the middle of the photo is the Robson Glacier. The river flowing from Robson Glacier drains into Berg Lake in the bottom right.</p> <p>Many geological features are shown here. The rocks that these mountains are made of formed in ocean water over 500 million years ago. A few hundred million years later, the rocks were pushed east for tens to hundreds of kilometres, and thousands of meters upward in a great collision between Earth&#8217;s tectonic plates.</p> <p>Over the past two million years this area, like most of the rest of Canada, has been repeatedly covered by glaciers that scoured away rocks to form the valley to the left of Rearguard Mountain. The Robson Glacier itself is now only a fraction of its  size during the Little Ice Age of the 15th to 18th centuries. And, like almost all other glaciers on Earth, it is now receding even more rapidly because of climate change. Figure 11.2 (right) taken around 1908 by the Canadian geologist and artist Arthur Philemon Coleman, gives an indication of how much the glacier has receded in the last hundred years.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_851" style="width: 1200px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=851" rel="attachment wp-att-851 noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Rearguard_today_vs_1908.png" alt="Rearguard Mountain and Robson Glacier in Mount Robson Provincial Park, BC.

They do hazard assessment and mitigation (e.g., assessment of risks from slope failures, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions).  They study the nature of the subsurface for construction projects such as highways, tunnels, and bridges. They use information about the subsurface for water supply planning, development, and management; and to decide how best to contain contaminants from waste.</p> <p>Geologists also do the research that makes practical applications of geology possible.  Some geologists spend their summers trekking through the wilderness to make maps of the rocks in a particular location, and collect clues about the geological processes that occurred there.  Some geologists work in laboratories analyzing the chemical and physical properties of rocks to understand how the rocks will behave when forces act on them, or when water flows through them.  Some geologists specialize in inventing ways to use complex instruments to make these measurements.  Geologists study fossils to understand ancient animals and environments, and go to extreme environments to understand how life might have originated on Earth.  Some geologists help NASA understand the data they receive from objects in space.</p> <p>Geological work can be done indoors in offices and labs, but some people are attracted to geology because they like to be outdoors.  Many geological opportunities involve fieldwork in places that are as amazing to see as they are interesting to study. Sometimes these are locations where few people have ever set foot, and where few ever will again.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_859" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Svalbard.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Svalbard.jpg" alt="Geologists at work on the island of Spitsbergen, part of the Svalbard archipelago.

The key features of serious inquiry are the following:</p> <ul><li>Creation of a <strong>hypothesis</strong>. This is a tentative idea about how to explain a set of observations.</li> <li>Test the hypothesis.  A hypothesis can be used to make predictions, and experiments can be run to see if those predictions are correct.</li> </ul> <h1>An Example of the Scientific Method at Work</h1> <p>Consider a field trip to the stream shown in Figure 1.5. Notice that the rocks in and along the stream are rounded off rather than having sharp edges. We might hypothesize that the rocks were rounded because as the stream carried them, they crashed into each other and pieces broke off.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_34" style="width: 875px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-34" height="738" width="875" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods.jpg 875w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods-300x253.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods-768x648.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods-65x55.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods-225x190.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/What-are-scientific-methods-350x295.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 1.5</strong> Hypothesizing about the origin of round rocks in a stream. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/What-are-scientific-methods.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>If the hypothesis is correct, then the further we go downstream, the rounder and smaller the rocks should be. Going upstream we should find that the rocks are more angular and larger. If we were patient we could also test the hypothesis by marking specific rocks and then checking back to see if those rocks have become smaller and more rounded as they moved downstream.</p> <p>If the predictions turn out to be correct, we must still be careful about how much certainty to attach to our hypothesis.  Although our hypothesis might seem to us to be the only reasonable explanation, someone could argue that we have the mechanism wrong, and the rocks weren&#8217;t rounded by bumping into each other. If our experiment didn&#8217;t specifically check for the mechanism (e.g., by looking to see if chips fall off the rocks and the rocks are made smoother) then we would have to acknowledge the possibility.  We needn&#8217;t abandon the hypothesis as a useful tool for making predictions, but it is necessary to be open to the possibility that other things might be going on. If someone demonstrates conclusively that our hypothesis is wrong, then we have to discard the hypothesis and come up with a better one.</p> <p>A good hypothesis is testable.  Someone might argue that an extraterrestrial organization creates rounded rocks and places them in streams when nobody is looking. There is no practical way to test this hypothesis to confirm it, and there is no way to prove it false. Even if we never see aliens at work, we still can&#8217;t say they haven&#8217;t been, because according to the hypothesis they only work when people aren&#8217;t looking. Compare this to our original hypothesis which allows us to make testable predictions such as rocks getting smaller and rounder downstream. Our original hypothesis gives us a way to see how realistic it is, whereas the alien hypothesis gives us no way to know if it makes sense or not.</p> <h1>Theories and Laws</h1> <p>Two other terms appear in discussions of the scientific method: <strong>theory</strong> and <strong>law</strong>. A <strong>theory</strong> starts out as a hypothesis, but over a long period of time and a great many tests, it has <em>never</em> come up short. That doesn&#8217;t mean it never will, but the odds of that are very unlikely given our present (and conceivable future) state of knowledge.  You may have heard someone dismiss an idea by saying it is &#8220;just a theory,&#8221; but they are using the term incorrectly if they mean to say it&#8217;s a wild and unproven guess.</p> <p>A <strong>law</strong> is a description of a phenomenon rather than an explanation of it.  For example, you could do thousands of tests by dropping an object with known mass and measuring its acceleration and the force with which it hits the ground.  Again and again your results will yield the formula <em>force = mass x acceleration</em>.  However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you know what is responsible for the force accelerating it toward the ground.  Yes, we say that gravity is pulling it toward the Earth&#8217;s surface, but <em>why</em>? A law is true regardless of why a phenomenon happens as long as it describes the outcome of that phenomenon.</p> </div></div>

The changes themselves might be tiny. For example, over a year, a chemical reaction might eat away a few layers of atoms at the surface of a rock. But over time the changes accumulate and have a great impact. Over hundreds of millions of years the chemical reaction could cause a mountain range to crumble into grains of sand, and be swept away by rivers.</p> <p>For geologists who study very, very slow processes, 10 million years might be a short time, and 1 million years might be trivial.  For these geologists, intervals of 1 million years aren&#8217;t even useful to consider, because the changes over that time are too small to see in the rocks that accumulated.</p> <p>As you read through this book, keep in mind that the well of geologic time is indeed deep, and &#8220;ancient&#8221; is defined in a whole new way.</p> <h2>Expressing Geological Time in Numbers</h2> <p>Special notation is used for geological time because, as you might imagine, writing all those zeroes can become tiresome.  Table 1.1 shows common abbreviations you will see throughout this book.</p> <table><tbody><tr><th style="text-align: left" colspan="3"><strong>Table 1.1 Abbreviations Used to Describe Geological Time</strong></th> </tr> <tr><th style="text-align: center"><strong>Abbreviation</strong></th> <th style="text-align: center"><strong>Meaning</strong></th> <th style="text-align: center"><strong>Example</strong></th> </tr> <tr><td style="text-align: center">Ga</td> <td><em>giga annum<br /> </em> or billions of years</td> <td>Earth is 4.57 Ga old.</td> </tr> <tr><td style="text-align: center">Ma</td> <td><em>mega annum<br /> </em> or millions of years</td> <td>Earth is 4,570 Ma old.</td> </tr> <tr><td style="text-align: center">ka</td> <td><em>kilo annum</em> or thousands of years</td> <td>The last glacial cycle ended 11,700 years ago, or 11.7 ka.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Expressing Geological Time Using the Geological Time Scale</h2> <p>The <strong>geological time scale</strong> (Figure 1.6) is a way of breaking down geological time according to important events in Earth&#8217;s history.  Time is divided into <strong>eons</strong>, <strong>eras</strong>, <strong>periods</strong>, and <strong>epochs</strong>, and these intervals are referred to by names rather than by years.  Giving intervals of geologic time names rather than using numbers makes sense because we won&#8217;t always know the age in years (the <strong>absolute</strong> <strong>age</strong>) of a rock or fossil, but we can place it in context based on our knowledge of the geological record.  We can describe its <strong>relative age </strong>by saying that it is older than or younger than another rock or fossil<strong>.<br /> </strong></p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_870" style="width: 2200px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale.png" alt="Geologic Society of America Geologic Time Scale, 2012" class="wp-image-870 size-full" height="1700" width="2200" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale.png 2200w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale-300x232.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale-768x593.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale-1024x791.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale-65x50.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale-225x174.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/timescale-350x270.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 1.6</strong> Geologic Society of America Geologic Time Scale, 2012. <em>Source: Walker, J.D., Geissman, J.W., Bowring, S.A., and Babcock, L.E., compilers (2012) Geologic Time Scale v. 4.0: Geological Society of America, doi: 10.1130/2012.CTS004R3C. <a href="https://www.geosociety.org/documents/gsa/timescale/timescl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a></em></div></div> <p>The tricky thing about the geologic time scale is that the boundaries are always changing.  As our knowledge of the absolute age of an event improves with new discoveries, it might be necessary to nudge a boundary earlier or later.  Sometimes the original reason for defining a boundary no longer holds, but we agree to use it anyway.  For example, the Phanerozoic Eon (the last 542 million years) is named for the time during which visible (<em>phaneros</em>) life (<em>zoi</em>) is present in the geological record, and its start was meant to mark the first appearance of these organisms.

The author refers to &#8220;the most extreme adherents of the Murchisonian party in geology,&#8221; a reference to the contentious assertion by Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison (1792-1871) that the Silurian Period should encompass the Cambrian and Ordovician periods as well.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_875" style="width: 864px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879.png" alt="Classification of the Lower Paleozoic Rocks.

Broadly speaking, the Proterozoic rocks include all the sedimentary formations to which the name Silurian has at any time been applied by the most extreme adherents of the Murchisonian party in geology." class="wp-image-875 size-full" height="493" width="864" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879-300x171.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879-768x438.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879-65x37.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879-225x128.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Proterozoic_1879-350x200.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 1.7</strong> An excerpt from the periodical <em>The Annals and Magazine of Natural History</em> (1879) in which the name &#8220;Proterozoic&#8221; is assigned to the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian periods instead of to the time preceding the Cambrian. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2017) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Annals_Magazine_of_Natural_History-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read the book</a></em></div></div> </div> <h2>A Way To Think About Geological Time</h2> <p>A useful mechanism for understanding geological time is to scale it down into one year. The origin of the solar system and Earth at 4.57 Ga would be represented by January 1, and the present year would be represented by the last tiny fraction of a second on New Year’s Eve. At this scale, each day of the year represents 12.5 million years; each hour represents about 500,000 years; each minute represents 8,694 years; and each second represents 145 years.

Note that the typeface prints an "s" like an "f."</span>.  Charles Lyell, also a Scottish geologist, paraphrased this idea as &#8220;the present is the key to the past&#8221; in his book <em>Principles of Geology</em>.<span class="footnote">The 7th edition of Charles Lyell's <em>Principles of Geology</em> (1847) can be found at http://bit.ly/1l3T6Zh</span>  This is how it is often described today.</p> <p>To be clear, &#8220;the present is the key to the past&#8221; can be viewed as an oversimplification. Not all geological processes occurring today occurred at all times in the geological past.  For example, some important chemical reactions that happened on Earth&#8217;s surface today require abundant oxygen in the atmosphere, and could not have occurred prior to Earth developing an oxygen-rich atmosphere.  Conversely, there was a time in Earth&#8217;s history when continents as we know them hadn&#8217;t yet developed. Some events, such as devastating impacts by objects from space, have never been witnessed on the same scale by humans. We must be cognizant of the fact that conditions were different at different times in Earth&#8217;s history, and take that into account when interpreting the rock record.</p> <p>Despite the different past conditions on Earth as a whole, there still exist environments today where some of these conditions are present. These environments are like little samples of what Earth used to be like.  This means we can still use present conditions to inform us about the past, but we have to think carefully about ways that such environments today differ from the ancient environments that no longer exist.</p> <h1>Plate Tectonics</h1> <p>It is only within the last 50 years or so that we have been able to answer questions like, &#8220;How did that mountain range get there?&#8221; and &#8220;Why do earthquakes happen where they do?&#8221;  The theory of <strong>plate tectonics</strong>&#8211; the idea that Earth&#8217;s surface is broken into large moving fragments, called <strong>plates</strong>&#8211; profoundly changed our perspective on how the Earth works.  Figure 1.8 shows Earth&#8217;s 15 largest tectonic plates, along with arrows indicating the plates&#8217; direction of motion, and how fast they go.  (Longer arrows mean faster motion.)  There are many more plates on Earth that are too small to show conveniently in Figure 1.8.

Plate tectonics not only explains why things have happened, but also allows us to predict what might happen in the future.</p> <p>Plate tectonics is covered in more detail later, however the key point is that Earth&#8217;s outer layer consists of rigid plates that are constantly interacting with each other as they move around the Earth.  The boundaries of plates move away from each other in some places, collide in others, and sometimes just slide past each other (illustrated by the red arrows in Figure 1.8). The plates can move because they are floating on a layer of weak rock that deforms as the plates travel, much the same way the filling in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich allows you to slide the top layer of bread across the bottom layer.</p> <p>Whether the plates move away from each other, collide, or just slide past each other determines things like the locations of mountain belts and volcanoes, where earthquakes happen, and the shapes and sizes of oceans and continents.</p> <h4>References</h4> <p>Cottrell, M.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-1-summary" title="Chapter 1 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">6</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>1.1 What is Geology?</h3> <p>Geology is the study of Earth. It is an integrated science that involves the application of many of the other sciences. Geologists must take into account the fact that the geological features we see today may have formed thousands, millions, or even billions of years ago, and over very long time spans.</p> <h3>1.2 Why Study Earth?</h3> <p>Geologists study Earth out of curiosity and for other, more practical reasons, including understanding the evolution of life on Earth; searching for resources; understanding risks from geological events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and slope failures; and documenting past environmental and climate changes so that we can understand how human activities are affecting Earth.</p> <h3>1.3 What Do Geologists Do?</h3> <p>Geologists work in the resource industry, and in efforts to protect the environment. Geologists work to minimize the risks from geological hazards (e.g., earthquakes), and to help the public understand those risks. Geologists investigate Earth materials in the field, in and in the lab.</p> <h3>1.4 We Study Earth Using the Scientific Method</h3> <p>Scientific inquiry requires a careful process of making a hypothesis and then testing it. If a hypothesis doesn&#8217;t pass the test, it&#8217;s time for a new one. A theory is a hypothesis that has been tested repeatedly and never failed a test. A law is a description of a natural process.</p> <h3>1.5 Three Big Ideas: Geological Time, Uniformitarianism, and Plate Tectonics</h3> <p><em>Geological time</em>: Earth is approximately 4,570,000,000 years old; that is, 4.57 billion years or 4.57 Ga or 4,570 Ma. It’s such a huge amount of time that even extremely slow geological processes can have an enormous impact.</p> <p><em>Uniformitarianism</em>: Processes that occur today also occurred in the geologic past.  We can use our observations of the present to understand the processes that shaped the Earth throughout its history.</p> <p><em>Plate tectonics</em>: Earth&#8217;s surface is broken into plates that move and interact with each other.  The interactions between these plates are key for understanding the mechanisms behind geologic processes.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>How does the element of time make geology different from the other sciences, such as chemistry and physics?</li> <li>List three ways in which geologists can contribute to society.</li> <li>The following dates are written with the abbreviations Ga, Ma, and ka. Express the dates in years. (For example, 2.3 Ma = 2,300,000 years) <ol><li>2.75 ka</li> <li>0.93 Ga</li> <li>4.2 Ma</li> <li>0.2 ka.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Dinosaurs first appear in the geological record in rocks from about 215 Ma and then most became extinct at 65 Ma. What percentage of geological time does this represent?</li> <li>If sediments typically accumulate at a rate of 1 mm/year, what thickness of sediment could accumulate over a period of 30 million years?</li> <li>Does uniformitarianism mean that conditions on Earth are uniform, and never change?</li> <li>Summarize the main idea behind plate tectonics.</li> </ol> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-answers-to-chapter-1-review-questions" title="Answers to Chapter 1 Review Questions"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">7</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Answers to Chapter 1 Review Questions</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <ol><li>Geology requires that we consider vast amounts of time, and think about the effects that accumulate over thousands, millions, or even billions of years.</li> <li>There are many ways that geologists contribute. Geologists provide information to reduce the risk of harm from hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and slope failures; they play a critical role in the discovery of important resources; they contribute to our understanding of life and its evolution through paleontological studies; and they play a leading role in the investigation of climate change, past and present and its implications.</li> <li>Ages in years <ol><li>2.75 ka = 2,750 years</li> <li>0.93 Ga = 930,000,000 years</li> <li>14.2 Ma = 14,200,000 years</li> <li>0.2 ka = 200 years.</li> </ol> </li> <li>215 &#8211; 65 = 150 Ma. Since the age of the Earth is 4570 Ma, this represents 150/4,570 = 0.033 or 3.3% of geological time.</li> <li>At 1 mm/y 30,000,000 mm of sediment would accumulate over that 30 million years. This is equivalent to 30,000 m or 30 km. Few sequences of sedimentary rock are even close to that thickness because most sediments accumulate at much lower rates, more like 0.1 mm/y. Also, over time the sediments are compressed.</li> <li>No. Uniformitarianism means that we can use the processes we observe today to help us understand what happened in the past.</li> <li>Plate tectonics is the idea that Earth&#8217;s outer layer is broken into rigid plates. The plates move around and interact with each other along their margins.</li> </ol> </div></div>

Creating a universe out of nothing is mostly beyond the scope of this chapter, but there is a way to think about it. The particles that make up the universe have opposites that cancel each other out, similar to the way that we can add the numbers 1 and -1 to get zero (also known as “nothing”). As far as the math goes, having zero is exactly the same as having a 1 and a -1. It is also exactly the same as having a 2 and a -2, a 3 and a -3, two -1s and a 2, and so on. In other words, <em>nothing</em> is really the potential for <em>something</em> if you divide it into its opposite parts.</p> <h1>Composition of the Universe</h1> <p>In Figure 2.2, the “contents” of the vessel change as time progresses. A few minutes after the big bang, the universe was still too hot and dense to be anything but a sizzle of particles smaller than atoms. But as it expanded, it also cooled. Eventually particles that collided were able to stick together to form atoms, rather than being smashed apart again when other particles crashed into them. Those collisions produced hydrogen and helium, the most common elements in the universe.</p> <p>For a long time after the big bang, clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms drifted about a dark universe. The “dark ages” (bottom of Figure 2.2) were a time when the ingredients for stars existed, but stars themselves did not. It took approximately 500 million years for enough hydrogen atoms to clump together in clouds to allow the first stars to form and begin to shine.</p> <h1>Looking Back to the Early Stages of the Big Bang</h1> <p>The notion of seeing the past is often used metaphorically when we talk about ancient events, but in this case it is meant literally. In our everyday experience, when we watch an event take place, we perceive that we are watching it as it unfolds in real time. In fact, this isn’t true. To see the event, light from that event must travel to our eyes. Light travels very rapidly, but it does not travel instantly. If we were watching a digital clock 1 m away from us change from 11:59 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., we would actually see it turn to 12:00 p.m. three billionths of a second after it happened.</p> <p>This isn’t enough of a delay to cause us to be late for an appointment, but the universe is a very big place, and the “digital clock” in question is often much, much farther away. In fact, the universe is so big that it is convenient to describe distances in terms of <strong>light years</strong>, or the distance light travels in one year. What this means is that light from distant objects takes so long to get to us that we see those objects as they were at some considerable time in the past. For example, the star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light years from the sun. If you viewed Proxima Centauri from Earth on&nbsp;January 1, 2018, you would actually see it as it appeared in early October 2013.</p> <p>We now have tools that are powerful enough to look deep into space and see the arrival of light from early in the universe’s history. Astronomers can detect light from approximately 380,000 years after the big bang is thought to have occurred. Physicists tell us that if the big bang happened, then particles within the universe would still be very close together at this time. They would be so close that light wouldn’t be able to travel far without bumping into another particle and getting scattered in another direction. The effect would be to fill the sky with glowing fog, the “afterglow” from the formation of the universe.</p> <p>In fact, this is exactly what we see when we look at light from 380,000 years after the big bang. The fog is referred to as the <strong>cosmic microwave background</strong> (or CMB), and it has been carefully mapped throughout the sky. In Figure 2.2, the colourful patch at the base of the diagram represents the fog that is measured today as the CMB. Figure 2.2 (right) is a CMB map of the universe in Mollweide projection. This is a projection that is used to show Earth’s geography on a flat surface. In this case, the map of the CMB represents a sphere surrounding Earth rather than what’s beneath our feet.</p> <p>Colour variations in the CMB map represent temperature variations. These variations translate to differences in the density at which matter was distributed in the early universe. The red patches are the highest density regions and the blue patches are the lowest density. Higher density regions represent the eventual beginnings of stars and planets. The CMB map in Figure 2.2 has been likened to a baby picture of the universe.</p> <h1>The Universe is Still Expanding<strong><br /> </strong></h1> <p>The expansion that started with the big bang never stopped. It continues today, and we can see it happen by observing that large clusters of billions of stars, called <strong>galaxies</strong>, are moving away from us. (An exception is the Andromeda galaxy with which we are on a collision course.) The astronomer Edwin Hubble came to this conclusion when he observed that the light from other galaxies was red-shifted. The <strong>red shift</strong> is a consequence of the Doppler effect. This refers to how we see waves when the object that is creating the waves is moving toward us or away from us.</p> <p>Before looking at the Doppler effect as it pertains to light, it can be useful to see how it works on something more tangible. The duckling swimming in Figure 2.3 is generating waves as it moves through the water. It is generating waves that move forward as well as back, but notice that the ripples ahead of the duckling are closer to each other than the ripples behind the duckling. The distance from one ripple to the next is called the <strong>wavelength</strong>. The wavelength is shorter in the direction that the duckling is moving, and longer as the duckling moves away.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_52" style="width: 425px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/figure22.3.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/figure22.3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-52 size-full" width="425" height="446" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/figure22.3.png 425w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/figure22.3-286x300.png 286w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/figure22.3-65x68.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/figure22.3-225x236.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/figure22.3-350x367.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 2.3</strong> A duckling illustrates the Doppler effect in water.

This is why an observer will hear a change in the pitch of a car’s engine as the car races past.</p> <p>For light waves, wavelength translates to colour. In the spectrum of light that we can see, shorter wavelengths are on the blue end of the spectrum, and longer wavelengths are on the red end of the spectrum. In Figure 2.4, the longer or shorter wavelengths of the water ripples at the top of the diagram reflect the longer or shorter wavelengths of light in the visible spectra below. Does this mean that galaxies look red because they are moving away from us? No, but the colour we see is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum and longer wavelengths.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1321" style="width: 504px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/red_shift_spectra-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1321"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/red_shift_spectra-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1321 size-full" width="504" height="364" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/red_shift_spectra-1.png 504w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/red_shift_spectra-1-300x217.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/red_shift_spectra-1-65x47.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/red_shift_spectra-1-225x163.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/red_shift_spectra-1-350x253.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 2.4</strong> Red shift in light from the supercluster BAS11 compared to the sun’s light.

The black lines are there because some colours are missing from the sun’s light that reaches Earth. Different elements absorb light of specific wavelengths, and many of the black lines in Figure 2.4 represent colours that are absorbed by hydrogen and helium within the sun. This means the black lines are like a bar code that can tell us what a star is made of.</p> <p>The lower spectrum in Figure 2.4 is the light coming from BAS11, an enormous cluster of approximately 10,000 galaxies located 1 billion light years away. The black lines represent the same elements as in the sun’s spectrum, but they are shifted to the right toward the red end of the spectrum, because BAS11 is moving away from us as the universe continues to expand. To summarize, because almost all of the galaxies we can see have light that is red-shifted, it means they are all moving away from us. In fact, the farther away they are, the faster they are going. This is evidence that the universe is still expanding.</p> <h4>References</h4> <p>European Space Agency (2015). <em>Planck reveals first stars were born late</em>. <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck/Planck_reveals_first_stars_were_born_late" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Visit website</a></p> <p>Knop, R.

Most of the remaining 5% comes from aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), nickel (Ni), hydrogen (H), and sulphur (S). We know that the big bang made hydrogen, but where did the rest of the elements come from?</p> <p>The answer is that the other elements were made by stars. Sometimes stars are said to “burn” their fuel, but burning is not what is going on within stars. The burning that happens when wood in a campfire is turned to ash and smoke is a chemical reaction — heat causes the atoms that were in the wood and in the surrounding atmosphere to exchange partners. Atoms group in different ways, but the atoms themselves do not change. What stars do is change the atoms. The heat and pressure within stars cause smaller atoms to smash together and fuse into new, larger atoms. For example, when hydrogen atoms smash together and fuse, helium is formed. Large amounts of energy are released when atoms fuse within stars, and this is what causes stars to shine. Stars can form large quantities of elements as heavy as iron during their normal burning process. Side reactions can form heavier elements in small amounts.</p> <p>It takes larger stars to make elements as heavy as iron in large quantities. Our sun is an average star. After it uses up its hydrogen fuel to make helium, and some of that helium is fused to make small amounts of other elements, it will be at the end of its life. It will stop making new elements and will cool down and bloat until its middle reaches the orbit of Mars. In contrast, large stars end their lives in spectacular fashion. They explode as supernovae, casting off newly formed atoms into space, and triggering side reactions to make even more heavy atoms. It took many generations of stars creating heavier elements and casting them into space before heavier elements were abundant enough for planets like Earth to form.</p> <p>Until recently, astronomers have only been able to see stars that already contain heavier elements in small amounts, but not the first-generation stars that started out before any of the heavier elements were produced. That changed in 2015 when it was announced that a distant galaxy called CR7 had been found that contained stars made only of hydrogen and helium. The galaxy is so far away that it shows us a view of the universe from approximately 800 million years after the big bang. Since then, more galaxies like CR7 have been discovered.</p> <h4>References</h4> <p>Pilipenko, S. V. (2013).

All solar systems start out the same way. They begin in a cloud of gas and dust called a <strong>nebula</strong>. Nebulae are some of the most beautiful objects that have been photographed in space. They have vibrant colours from the gases and dust they contain, and brilliant twinkling from the many stars that have formed within them (Figure 2.5).

Exactly how this starts isn’t clear, although it might be triggered by the violent behaviour of nearby stars as they progress through their life cycles. Energy and matter released by these stars might compress the gas and dust in nearby neighbourhoods within the nebula.</p> <p>Once it is triggered, the collapse of gas and dust within that patch continues for two reasons. One of those reasons is that gravitational force pulls gas molecules and dust particles together. But early in the process, those particles are very small, so the gravitational force between them isn’t strong. So how do they come together? The answer is that dust first accumulates in loose clumps for the same reason dust bunnies form under the bed: static electricity. Given the role of dust bunnies in the early history of the solar system, one might speculate that an accumulation of dust bunnies poses a substantial risk to one’s home (Figure 2.6). In practice, however, this is rarely the case.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1333" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/dust_bunnies.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/dust_bunnies.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1333" width="720" height="377" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/dust_bunnies.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/dust_bunnies-300x157.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/dust_bunnies-65x34.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/dust_bunnies-225x118.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/dust_bunnies-350x183.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 2.6</strong> Public service announcement.

Bottom: Solar system with the sun and planets to scale. The gas giants are the largest planets, followed by the ice giants, and then the terrestrial planets. Note that the planets in this diagram likely do not reflect the entire population of planets in our solar system because evidence suggests that large planets are present beyond the Kuiper belt. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, Milky Way photo by R@pp (2017) CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 <a href="https://flic.kr/p/TM5Ssm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source,</a> planet photographs courtesy of NASA.

The frost line marks the division between the inner part of the protoplanetary disk closer to the sun, where it was too hot to permit anything but silicate minerals and metal to crystalize, and the outer part of the disk farther from the sun, where it was cool enough to allow ice to form. As a result, the objects that formed in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk consist largely of rock and metal, while the objects that formed in the outer part consist largely of gas and ice. The young sun blasted the solar system with raging <strong>solar winds </strong>(winds made up of energetic particles), which helped to drive lighter molecules toward the outer part of the protoplanetary disk.</p> <h2>Rules of the Accretion Game</h2> <p>The objects in our solar system formed by <strong>accretion</strong>. Early in this process, particles collected in fluffy clumps because of static electricity. As the clumps grew larger, gravity became more important and collected clumps into solid masses, and solid masses into larger and larger bodies. If you were one of these bodies in the early solar system, and participating in the “accretion game” with the goal of becoming a planet, you would have to follow some key rules:</p> <ul><li>Keep your velocity just right. If you move too fast and collide with another body, you both smash up and have to start again. If you move slowly enough, gravity will keep you from bouncing off each other and you can grow larger.</li> <li>Your distance from the Sun will determine how big you can get. If you are closer, there is less material for you to collect than if you are farther away.</li> <li>To begin with, you can only collect mineral and rock particles. You have to grow above a certain mass before your gravity is strong enough to hang onto gas molecules, because gas molecules are very light.</li> <li>As your mass increases, your gravity becomes stronger and you can grab material from farther away. The bigger you are, the faster you grow.</li> </ul> <p>You would also have to watch out for some dangers:</p> <ul><li>In the early stages of the game, the protoplanetary disk is turbulent, and you and other objects can get thrown into different orbits or at each other. This might be a good thing, or it might not, depending on how the rules above apply to you.</li> <li>If the game progresses to the point where there is no more material within your reach and you are not yet a planet, then it’s game over.</li> <li>If you slow down too much (e.g., from bumping into other objects), you could spiral into the Sun (game over).</li> <li>If another planet gets big enough, it can: <ul><li>Rip you apart and then swing the pieces around so fast that for the rest of the game you collide too hard with other pieces to grow any bigger (game over)</li> <li>Fling you out of the solar system (game over)</li> <li>Grab you for itself (game over)</li> <li>Trap you in an orbit around it, turning you into a moon (game over, and incredibly humiliating)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>Winners and Losers</h2> <p>The outcome of the game is evident in Figure 2.9. Today eight official winners are recognized, with Jupiter taking the grand prize, followed closely by Saturn. Both planets have trophy cases with more than 60 moons each, and each has a moon that is larger than Mercury. Prior to 2006, Pluto was also counted a winner, but in 2006 a controversial decision revoked Pluto’s planet status. The reason was a newly formalized definition of a planet, which stated that an object can only be considered a planet if it is massive enough to have swept its orbit clean of other bodies. Pluto is situated within the icy clutter of the Kuiper belt, so it does not fit this definition.</p> <p>Pluto’s supporters have argued that Pluto should have been grandfathered in, given that the definition came after Pluto was declared a planet, but to no avail. Pluto has not given up, and on July 13, 2015, it launched an emotional plea with the help of the NASA’s New Horizons probe. New Horizons sent back images of Pluto’s heart (Figure 2.10). On closer inspection, Pluto’s heart was discovered to be broken.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_61" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.10-e1441140386417.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.10-e1441140386417.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-61" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.10-e1441140386417.png 600w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.10-e1441140386417-300x150.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.10-e1441140386417-65x33.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.10-e1441140386417-225x113.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.10-e1441140386417-350x175.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 2.10</strong> Photographs of Pluto.

Large patches of Earth’s surface would still be molten, which would make landing your time machine very dangerous indeed. If you happened to have one of the newer time-machine models with hovering capabilities and heat shields, you would still face the inconvenience of having nothing to breathe but a tenuous wisp of hydrogen and helium gas, and depending on how much volcanic activity was going on, volcanic gases such as water vapour and carbon dioxide. Some ammonia and methane might be thrown in just to make it interesting, but there would be no oxygen. Assuming you had the foresight to purchase the artificial atmosphere upgrade for your time machine, it would all be for naught if you materialized just in time to see an asteroid, or worse yet another planet, bearing down on your position. The moral of the story is that early Earth was a nasty place, and a time machine purchase is not something to take lightly.</p> <p>Why was early Earth so nasty?</p> <h1>Earth Was Hot</h1> <p>Earth’s heat comes from the decay of radioactive elements within Earth, as well as from processes associated with Earth’s formation. Formation processes contributed heat in the following ways:</p> <ul><li>Heat came from the thermal energy already contained within the objects that accreted to form Earth.</li> <li>Heat came from collisions. When objects hit Earth, some of the energy from their motion went into deforming Earth, and some of it was transformed into heat. Clap your hands vigorously to experience this on a much smaller (and safer!) scale.</li> <li>As Earth became larger, its gravitational force became stronger. This increased Earth’s ability to draw objects to it, but it also caused the material making Earth to be compressed, rather like Earth giving itself a giant gravitational hug. Compression causes materials to heat up.</li> </ul> <p>Heating had an important consequence for Earth’s structure. As Earth grew, it collected a mixture of rocky silicate mineral grains as well as iron and nickel. These materials were scattered throughout Earth. That changed when Earth began to heat up: it got so hot that the metals melted and trickled down through the rocky silicate material toward Earth&#8217;s centre, becoming Earth&#8217;s core. The silicate material became Earth&#8217;s crust and mantle. In other words, Earth unmixed itself. The separation of silicate minerals and metals into a rocky outer layer and a metallic core, respectively, is called <strong>differentiation</strong>. Friction from metal melts moving through Earth caused it to heat up even more.</p> <p>Earth’s high temperature early in its history also means that early tectonic processes were accelerated compared to today, and Earth’s surface was more geologically active.</p> <h1>Earth Was Bombarded by Objects from Space</h1> <p>Although Earth had swept up a substantial amount of the material in its orbit as it was accreting, unrest within the solar system caused by changes in the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter was still sending many large objects on cataclysmic collision courses with Earth. The energy from these collisions repeatedly melted and even vaporized minerals in the crust, and blasted gases out of Earth’s atmosphere. Very old scars from these collisions are still detectable, although we have to look carefully to see them. For example, the oldest impact site discovered is the 3 billion year old Maniitsoq “crater” in west Greenland, although there is no crater to see. What is visible are rocks that were 20 km to 25 km below Earth’s surface at the time of the impact, but which nevertheless display evidence of deformation that could only be produced by intense, sudden shock.</p> <p>The evidence of the very worst collision that Earth experienced is not subtle at all. In fact, you have probably looked directly at it hundreds of times already, perhaps without realizing what it is. That collision was with a planet named Theia, which was approximately the size of Mars. Not long after Earth formed, Theia struck Earth (Figure 2.11). When Theia slammed into Earth, Theia’s metal core merged with Earth’s core, and debris from the outer silicate layers was cast into space, forming a ring of rubble around Earth. The material within the ring coalesced into a new body in orbit around Earth, giving us our moon. Remarkably, the debris may have coalesced in 10 years or fewer! This scenario for the formation of the moon is called the <strong>giant impact hypothesis</strong><strong>. </strong></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_65" style="width: 410px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.11.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-65 size-full" width="410" height="333" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.11.png 410w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.11-300x244.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.11-65x53.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.11-225x183.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/22.11-350x284.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 2.11</strong> Artist’s impression of a collision between planets.

It started out with a thin veil of hydrogen and helium gases that came with the material it accreted. But hydrogen and helium are very light gases, and they bled off into space.</p> <p>Earth’s second experiment with having an atmosphere went much better. Volcanic eruptions built up the atmosphere by releasing gases. The most common volcanic gases are water vapour and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but volcanoes release a wide variety of gases. Other important contributions include sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S), hydrogen gas, and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Meteorites and comets also brought substantial amounts of water and nitrogen to Earth. It is not clear what the exact composition of the atmosphere was after Earth’s second experiment, but carbon dioxide, water vapour, and nitrogen were likely the three most abundant components.</p> <p>One thing we can say for sure about Earth’s second experiment is that there was effectively no <strong>free oxygen</strong> (O<sub>2</sub>, the form of oxygen that we breathe) in the atmosphere. We know this in part because prior to 2 billion years ago, there were no rocks stained red from oxidized iron minerals. Iron minerals were present, but not in oxidized form. At that time, O<sub>2</sub> was produced in the atmosphere when the sun’s ultraviolet rays split water molecules apart. However, chemical reactions removed the oxygen as quickly as it was produced.</p> <p>It wasn’t until well into Earth’s third experiment — life — that the atmosphere became oxygenated. Photosynthetic organisms used the abundant CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to manufacture their food, and released O<sub>2</sub> as a by-product. At first all of the oxygen was consumed by chemical reactions as before, but eventually the organisms released so much O<sub>2</sub> that it overwhelmed the chemical reactions. Oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, although present levels of 21% oxygen didn’t occur until about 350 million years ago. Today the part of our atmosphere that isn’t oxygen consists largely of nitrogen (78%).</p> <p>The oxygen-rich atmosphere on our planet is life’s signature. If geologic processes were the only ones controlling our atmosphere, it would consist mostly of carbon dioxide, like the atmosphere of Venus. It is an interesting notion (or a disconcerting one, depending on your point of view) that for the last 2 billion years the light reflected from our planet has been beaming a bar code out to the universe, similar to the ones in Figure 2.4, except ours says “oxygen.” For 2 billion years, our planet has been sending out a signal that could cause an observer from another world to say, “That’s odd… I wonder what’s going on over there.”</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-2-5-are-there-other-earths-2" title="2.5 Are There Other Earths?"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">12</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">2.5 Are There Other Earths?</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>As of January 2018, 6,355 possible <strong>exoplanets</strong>&#8211; extrasolar planets, or planets outside of our solar system- have been detected by preliminary tests. Further tests have confirmed that 3,726 of those candidates are indeed planets. If &#8220;other Earths&#8221; are defined as planets where we could walk out of a spaceship with no equipment other than a picnic basket, and enjoy a pleasant afternoon on a grassy slope near a stream, then it remains to be seen whether any of these planets fit the description. On the other hand, if &#8220;other Earths&#8221; refers to rocky worlds approximately Earth’s size, and orbiting within their star’s <strong>habitable zone</strong> (the zone in which liquid water, and potentially life, can exist), then there is cautious optimism that we have found at least 53 such worlds.</p> <p>Part of the uncertainty about the 53 possible Earth-like worlds is related to their composition. We don’t yet know their composition; however, it is tempting to conclude that they are rocky because they are similar in size to Earth. Remember the rules of the accretion game: you can only begin to collect gas once you are a certain size, and how much matter you collect depends on how far away from the sun you are. Given how large our gas giant and ice giant planets are compared to Earth, and how far away they are from the sun, we would expect that a planet similar in size to Earth, and a similar distance from its star, should be rocky.</p> <p>But it isn’t quite as simple as that. We are finding that the rules to the accretion game can result in planetary systems very different from our own. For example, in the planetary systems we have observed, it is common to have planets larger than Earth orbiting closer to their star than Mercury does to the sun. Planets as large as Jupiter are rare, and where large planets do exist, they are much closer to their star than Jupiter is to the sun. To summarize, we need to be cautious about drawing conclusions from our own solar system, just in case we are basing those conclusions on something truly unusual.</p> <p>On the other hand, the seemingly unique features of our solar system would make planetary systems like ours difficult to spot. One of the ways exoplanets are detected is by measuring the brightness of stars, and looking for tiny variations in brightness that could be caused by a planet passing between the star it orbits and the instrument observing the star. Small planets are harder to detect because they block less of a star’s light than larger planets. Larger planets farther from a star, like our gas giant planets, are difficult to spot because they don’t go past the star as frequently. For example, Jupiter goes around the sun once every 12 years. If someone were observing our solar system, they might have to watch for 12 years to see Jupiter go past the sun once. For Saturn, they might have to watch for 30 years.</p> <div><h1>If Habitable Zone Planets Are Terrestrial, Could We Live There?</h1> <p>The operational definition of “other Earths” involving a terrestrial composition, a size constraint of one to two times that of Earth, and location within a star’s habitable zone, does not preclude worlds incapable of supporting life as we know it. By those criteria, Venus is an “other Earth,” albeit right on the edge of the habitable zone for our sun. Venus is much too hot for us, with a constant surface temperature of 465°C (lead melts at 327°C). Its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and the atmospheric pressure at its surface is 92 times higher than on Earth. Any liquid water on its surface boiled off long ago. Yet the characteristics that make Venus a terrible picnic destination aren’t entirely things we could predict from its distance from the sun. They depend in part on the geochemical evolution of Venus- at one time Venus might have been a lot more like a youthful Earth. These are the kinds of things we won’t know about until we can look carefully at the atmospheres and compositions of habitable-zone exoplanets.</p> <h4>Keep Up-To-Date on the Exoplanet Count</h4> <p>Look up the latest count of potential and confirmed exoplanets in the <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extrasolar Planets Catalog</a>.</p> <p>Look up the latest number of potentially habitable exoplanets in the <a href="http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Habitable Exoplanets Catalog</a>.</p> </div> </div></div>

Evidence for the big bang is the cosmic “afterglow” from when the universe was still very dense, and red-shifted light from distant galaxies, which tell us the universe is still expanding.</p> <h3>2.2 Forming Planets from the Remnants of Exploding Stars</h3> <p>The big bang produced hydrogen, helium, but heavier elements come from nuclear fusion reactions in stars. Large stars make elements such as silicon, iron, and magnesium, which are important in forming terrestrial planets. Large stars explode as supernovae and scatter the elements into space.</p> <h3>2.3 How to Build a Solar System</h3> <p>Solar systems begin with the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust. Material drawn to the centre forms a star, and the remainder forms a disk around the star. Material within the disk clumps together to form planets. In our solar system, rocky planets are closer to the sun, and ice and gas giants are farther away. This is because temperatures near the sun were too high for ice to form, but silicate minerals and metals could solidify.</p> <h3>2.4 Earth&#8217;s First 2 Billion Years</h3> <p>Early Earth was heated by radioactive decay, collisions with bodies from space, and gravitational compression. Heating caused molten metal to sink to Earth’s centre and form a core, and silicate minerals to form the mantle and crust. A collision with a planet the size of Mars knocked debris into orbit around Earth, and the debris coalesced into the moon. Earth’s atmosphere is the result of volcanic degassing, contributions by comets and meteorites, and photosynthesis.</p> <h3>2.5 Are There Other Earths?</h3> <p>The search for exoplanets has identified 53 planets that are similar in size to Earth and within the habitable zone of their stars. These are thought to be rocky worlds like Earth, but the compositions of these planets are not known for certain.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <p>1. How can astronomers view events that happened in the universe’s distant past?</p> <p>2. In this image of three spectra, one is from the sun, and the other two are from galaxies.

Astronomers looking for some of the earliest stars in the universe were surprised to find a planetary system called HIP 11952, which existed 12.8 billion years ago. This was very early in the universe’s history, when stars still consisted largely of hydrogen and helium. Do you think there were terrestrial planets in this system? Why or why not?</p> <p>4. Summarize the trends in size and composition of objects in the solar system.</p> <p>5. What is the frost line, and what does it help to explain?</p> <p>6.  Why is Pluto not considered a planet?</p> <p>7. What is differentiation?</p> <p>8. The exoplanet Kepler-452b is within the habitable zone of its star. In our solar system, planets a similar distance from the Sun are terrestrial planets. Why can we not say for certain that Kepler-452b’s distance from its star means it is a terrestrial planet?</p> <p>9. Of the planetary systems discovered thus far, none are exactly like our solar system. Does this mean our solar system is unique in the universe?</p> </div></div>

To see an event, light from that event must reach our eyes. Light travels very quickly (about 300,000,000 m/s), but the universe is very, very large. Depending on how far away the event was, it could take billions of years for light to travel from the event to our eyes so we can see it. Astronomers take advantage of this fact to view the universe’s past.</p> <p>2. B is the spectrum from the Andromeda galaxy. We know that one spectrum represents the sun, which is not moving toward or away from us. (Our orbit is not perfectly circular, but the small eccentricity is not a factor in this comparison.) We know that the Andromeda galaxy is on a collision course with us, so it is the exception to the rule that galaxies are moving away from us, and their light is red-shifted. That means the spectrum B which is shifted furthest to the left (blue-shifted) is Andromeda, and spectrum A which is furthest to the right (red-shifted) is a galaxy moving away from us. That means C is the sun.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1533" style="width: 331px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/spectra.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1533" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/spectra.png" alt="Spectra for the sun and two galaxies.

The planetary system consisted of two Jupiter-sized gas giant planets. Gas giant planets contain large amounts of hydrogen, and hydrogen was plentiful in the early universe. In contrast, terrestrial planets have heavier elements, especially silica, iron, magnesium, and nickel, that had yet to be manufactured by stars. Those elements were not present in sufficient abundance to form terrestrial planets until much later.</p> <p>4. Closest to the sun we find the small, rocky, terrestrial planets with metal cores. Further out are the gas giant planets, which are the largest in the solar system. They consist mostly of hydrogen, and have cores of rock and ice. Beyond the gas giant planets are the ice giant planets, which are next largest. They have a mantle of ice (not just water ice but ammonia and methane ice), and a rocky core. Smaller objects in the solar system include rocky bodies within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and bodies of ice and dust in the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud beyond Neptune.</p> <p>5. The frost line marks the distance from the sun beyond which temperatures were cool enough to allow ice to form. This helps to explain why the terrestrial planets are closer to the sun, and the Jovian and ice giant planets farther away. Mineral grains could solidify and begin to accrete closer to the sun, forming terrestrial planets, because they have higher melting points. In contrast, water vapour, methane, and ammonia had to be farther from the sun before they could freeze and begin to accrete.</p> <p>6. Planets are defined as having cleared their orbits of debris. Pluto is located within the Kuiper belt, so it shares its orbit with other objects. There are two other criteria in the definition of a planet: planets in our solar system must orbit the sun, and they must have a spherical shape. Pluto satisfies both these criteria, but sadly the people deciding whether or not Pluto should be a planet are not amenable to a “best two out of three” compromise.</p> <p>7. Differentiation is the separation of materials within a planet such that dense materials sink to the core. In Earth’s case, the denser materials are iron and nickel.</p> <p>8. The fact that we have terrestrial planets close to the sun makes sense in terms of the frost line, but it does not seem to be a hard-and-fast rule in other planetary systems. Therefore, we can’t conclude from Kepler-452b’s position alone that it is a terrestrial planet.</p> <p>9. The rules of the accretion game mean that there are many complex interactions, so even a small difference in the starting conditions or in how the game goes in the beginning could have major implications in the end. For that reason, we shouldn’t expect to find a planetary system that matches ours in every minute detail. However, just because we haven’t found a similar planetary system does not mean one does not exist. Our planet-finding methods are biased toward discovering large planets orbiting close to their stars, whereas our solar system has small planets close to the sun and larger ones farther away.

If the Tablelands appear out of place, it’s because they are. The Tablelands are one of few places on Earth where you can walk directly on the rocks of Earth’s mantle, thanks to an accident of plate tectonics that happened hundreds of millions of years ago. The red colour of the Tablelands rocks comes from iron-bearing minerals reacting with oxygen. Unaltered, the rocks are dark green (Figure 3.2). The rocks lack vegetation because the chemical composition of the rocks does not provide adequate nutrients for plants.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1737" style="width: 324px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-1737" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite-1024x660.jpeg" alt="" width="324" height="209" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite-1024x660.jpeg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite-300x193.jpeg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite-768x495.jpeg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite-65x42.jpeg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite-225x145.jpeg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite-350x226.jpeg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Tablelands-ophiolite.jpeg 1260w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.2</strong> Tablelands mantle rock with reddish weathering rind, and dark green fresh surface.

There are two kinds of crust: <strong>continental crust</strong>, and <strong>ocean crust</strong>. Continental crust is thicker, and predominantly <strong>felsic</strong> in composition, meaning that it contains minerals that are richer in silica. The composition is important because it makes continental crust less dense than ocean crust.</p> <p>Ocean crust is thinner, and predominantly <strong>mafic</strong> in composition.  Mafic rocks contain minerals with less silica, but more iron and magnesium. Mafic rocks (and therefore ocean crust) are denser than the felsic rocks of continental crust.</p> <p>The crust floats on the mantle.  Continental crust floats higher in the mantle than ocean crust because of the lower density of continental crust.  An important consequence of the difference in density is that if tectonic plates happen to bring ocean crust and continental crust into collision, the plate with ocean crust will be forced down into the mantle beneath the plate with continental crust.</p> <h1>Mantle</h1> <p>The mantle is almost entirely solid rock, but it is in constant motion, flowing very slowly. It is <strong>ultramafic</strong> in composition, meaning it has even more iron and magnesium than mafic rocks, and even less silica.  Although the mantle has a similar chemical composition throughout, it has layers with different mineral compositions and different physical properties.  It can have different mineral compositions and still be the same in chemical composition because the increasing pressure deeper in the mantle causes mineral structures to be reconfigured.</p> <p>Rocks higher in the mantle are typically composed of <strong>peridotite</strong>, a rock dominated by the minerals olivine and pyroxene. The Tablelands rock in Figure 3.2 is a type of peridotite. Lower in the mantle, extreme pressures transform minerals and create rocks like <strong>eclogite</strong> (Figure 3.5), which contains garnets.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1757" style="width: 420px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite-1024x557.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1757" height="228" width="420" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite-300x163.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite-768x418.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite-65x35.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite-225x122.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/JSt_John_eclogite-350x190.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.5</strong> Eclogite from the Swiss-Italian Alps.

The weakness of the asthenosphere is important for plate tectonics because it deforms as fragments of lithosphere move around upon and through it. Without a weak asthenosphere, plates would be locked in place, unable to move as they do now.</p> <h2>D&#8221;</h2> <p>The <strong>D&#8221;</strong> (dee double prime) layer is a mysterious layer beginning approximately 200 km above the boundary between the core and mantle.  (This boundary is referred to as the <strong>core-mantle boundary</strong>.)  We know it exists because of how seismic waves change speed as they move through it, but it isn&#8217;t clear why it&#8217;s different from the rest of the mantle.  One idea is that it is minerals are undergoing another transition in this region because of pressure and temperature conditions, similar to the transition between the upper and lower mantle. Other ideas are that small pools of melt are present, or that the differences in seismic properties are due to subducted slabs of lithosphere resting on the core-mantle boundary.</p> <h1>Core</h1> <p>The core is primarily composed of iron, with lesser amounts of nickel. Lighter elements such as sulfur, oxygen, or silicon may also be present. The core is extremely hot (~3500° to more than 6000°C). But despite the fact that the boundary between the inner and outer core is approximately as hot as the surface of the sun, only the outer core is liquid. The inner core is solid because the pressure at that depth is so high that it keeps the core from melting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-3-2-understanding-earth-through-seismology-2" title="3.2 Imaging Earth's Interior"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">16</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">3.2 Imaging Earth's Interior</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p><strong>Seismology</strong> is the study of vibrations within Earth. These vibrations are caused by events such as earthquakes, extraterrestrial impacts, explosions, storm waves hitting the shore, and tides. Seismology is applied to the detection and study of earthquakes, but seismic waves also provide important information about Earth’s interior.</p> <p>Seismic waves travel through different materials at different speeds, and we can apply knowledge of how they interact with different materials to understand Earth&#8217;s layers and internal structures. Similar to the way that ultrasound is used to image the human body, we can measure how long it takes for seismic waves to travel from their source to a recording station.</p> <p>Another feature of seismic waves is that some, called <strong>P-waves</strong>, can travel rapidly though both liquids and solids, but others, called <strong>S-waves</strong>, can only travel though solids, and are slower than P-waves. Observing where P-waves travel, and S-waves do not, allows us to identify regions within Earth that are melted.</p> <h1>Seismic Wave Paths</h1> <p>Seismic waves travel in all directions from their source, but it is convenient to imagine the path traced by one point on the wave front, and represent that path as a <strong>seismic ray</strong> (arrows, Figure 3.6).</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1785" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path-1024x365.png" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1785" height="365" width="1024" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path-1024x365.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path-300x107.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path-768x274.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path-225x80.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/ray_path-350x125.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.6</strong> Seismic waves and seismic rays. The paths of seismic waves can be represented as rays. Seismic ray paths are bent when they enter a rock layer with a different seismic velocity. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <p>When seismic waves encounter a different rock layer, some might bounce off the layer, or <strong>reflect</strong>, as in the bottom layer of Figure 3.6. But some waves will travel through the layer. If the wave travels at a different speed in the new layer, its path will be bent, or <strong>refracted</strong>, as it crosses into the new layer. If the wave can travel faster in the new layer, it will be bent slightly toward the contact between the two layers. In Figure 3.6, the ray can travel progressively faster in each layer as it goes down through the layers, and it is bent slightly upward each time it crosses into the next layer. The reverse happens if the wave slows down. On the right side of the diagram, the wave is moving upward through slower and slower layers. It is bent away from the faster layer each time, causing it to take a more direct path to the surface.</p> <p>Seismic velocities are higher in more rigid layers, so broadly speaking, they get faster deeper within Earth, because higher pressures make layers more rigid. They tend to take curved paths through the Earth because refraction bends their path until they are reflected and directed upward again, as in Figure 3.6.</p> <h1>Discoveries with Seismic Waves</h1> <h2>The Moho: Where Crust Meets Mantle</h2> <p>One of the first discoveries about Earth’s interior made through seismology was in the early 1900s by Croatian seismologist Andrija Mohorovičić (pronounced <em>Moho-ro-vi-chich</em>).  He noticed that sometimes, seismic waves arrived at seismic stations (measuring locations) farther from an earthquake <em>before </em>they arrived at closer ones.  He reasoned that the waves that traveled farther were faster because they bent down and traveled faster through different rocks (those of the mantle) before being bent upward back into the crust (Figure 3.7).</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1789" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE-1024x244.png" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1789" height="244" width="1024" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE-1024x244.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE-300x71.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE-768x183.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE-65x15.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE-225x54.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE-350x83.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/moho_SE.png 1205w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.7</strong> Depiction of seismic waves emanating from an earthquake (red star).

When an earthquake occurs, there is a zone on the opposite side of Earth where S-waves are not measured. This <strong>S-wave shadow zone</strong> begins 103° on either side of the earthquake, for a total angular distance of 154° (Figure 3.8, left). There is also a <strong>P-wave shadow zone</strong> on either side of the earthquake, from 103° to 150° (Figure 3.8, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1795" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE-1024x480.png" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1795" height="480" width="1024" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE-300x141.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE-768x360.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE-65x30.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE-225x105.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/shadow-2-SE-350x164.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.8</strong> Patterns of seismic wave propagation through Earth’s mantle and core.

The P-wave shadow zone occurs because seismic velocities are much lower in the liquid outer core than in the overlying mantle, and the P-waves are refracted in a way that leaves a gap.

Gradients are lowest in the central parts of continents, higher where plates collide, and higher still at boundaries where plates are moving away from each other.</p> <p>In spite of high temperatures within Earth, mantle rocks are almost entirely solid. High pressures keep them from melting. The red dashed line in Figure 3.11 (right) shows the minimum temperature at which dry mantle rocks will melt. Rocks at temperatures to the left of the line will remain solid. In rocks at temperatures to the right of the line, <em>some</em> minerals will begin to melt. Notice that the red dashed line goes further to the right for greater depths, and therefore greater pressures. Now compare the geothermal gradient with the red dashed line. The geothermal gradient is to the left of the red line, except in the asthenosphere, where small amounts of melt are present.</p> <h1>Convection Helps to Move Heat Within Earth</h1> <p>The fact that the temperature gradient is much lower in the main part of the mantle than in the lithosphere has been interpreted as evidence of <strong>convection</strong> in the mantle. When the mantle convects, heat is transferred through the mantle by physically moving hot rocks. Mantle convection is the result of heat transfer from the core to the base of the lower mantle. As with a pot of soup on a hot stove (Figure 3.12), the material near the heat source (the soup at the bottom of the pot) becomes hot and expands, making it less dense than the material above. Buoyancy causes it to rise, and cooler material flows in from the sides. Of course, convection in the soup pot is much faster than convection in the mantle. Mantle convection occurs at rates of centimetres per year.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1772" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/convection_soup_pot.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/convection_soup_pot-300x108.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1772 size-medium" height="108" width="300" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/convection_soup_pot-300x108.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/convection_soup_pot-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/convection_soup_pot-225x81.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/convection_soup_pot-350x126.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/convection_soup_pot.png 672w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.12</strong> Convection in a pot of soup on a hot stove (left).

Conduction is heat transfer by collisions between molecules, and is how heat is transferred from the stove to the soup pot. A convecting mantle is an essential feature of plate tectonics, because the higher rate of heat transfer is necessary to keep the asthenosphere weak. Earth’s mantle will stop convecting once the core has cooled to the point where there is not enough heat transfer to overcome the strength of the rock. This has already happened on smaller planets like Mercury and Mars, as well as on Earth’s moon. When mantle convection stops, the end of plate tectonics will follow.</p> <h2>Models of Mantle Convection</h2> <p>In the soup pot example, convection moves hot soup from the bottom of the pot to the top. Some geologists think that Earth&#8217;s convection works the same way— hot rock from the base of the mantle moves all the way to the top of the mantle before cooling and sinking back down again. This view is referred to as <strong>whole-mantle convection</strong> (Figure 3.8, left). Other geologists think that the upper and lower mantle are too different to convect as one. They point to slabs of lithosphere that are sinking back into the mantle, some of which seem to perch on the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, rather than sinking straight through. They also note chemical differences in magma originating in different parts of the mantle— differences that are not consistent with the entire mantle being well stirred. They argue that <strong>double-layered convection</strong> is a better fit with the observations (Figure 3.13, right).  Still others argue that there may be some locations where convection goes from the bottom of the mantle to the top, and some where it doesn&#8217;t (Figure 3.13, middle).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1776" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection-1024x435.png" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1776" height="435" width="1024" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection-1024x435.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection-300x127.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection-768x326.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection-65x28.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection-225x95.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/mantle_convection-350x149.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.13</strong> Models of mantle convection.

These include the heat contained in the objects that accreted to form Earth, and the heat produced when they collided. As Earth grew larger, the increased pressure on Earth&#8217;s interior caused it to compress and heat up.  Heat also came from friction when melted material was redistributed within Earth, forming the core and mantle.</p> <p>A major source of Earth&#8217;s heat is <strong>radioactivity</strong>, the energy released when the unstable atoms decay. The radioactive isotopes uranium-235 (<sup>235</sup>U), uranium-238 (<sup>238</sup>U), potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K), and thorium-232 (<sup>232</sup>Th) in Earth&#8217;s mantle are the primary source. Radioactive decay produced more heat early in Earth&#8217;s history than it does today, because fewer atoms of those isotopes are left today (Figure 3.14). Heat contributed by radioactivity is now roughly a quarter what it was when Earth formed.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1851" style="width: 303px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/radio_heat_SE.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/radio_heat_SE.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1851" height="282" width="303" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/radio_heat_SE.png 568w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/radio_heat_SE-300x279.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/radio_heat_SE-65x60.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/radio_heat_SE-225x209.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/radio_heat_SE-350x325.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.14</strong> Production of heat within the Earth over time by radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.

Spontaneous reversals can happen because convection does not occur in an orderly way, in spite of what the bar magnet analogy may suggest. Many small-scale variations occur in convection patterns within the inner core, and Earth&#8217;s magnetic field over all is the sum of those variations. Magnetic reversals do not happen as frequently as they might, if not for the solid inner core. Magnetic field changes take much longer within the inner core, so reversals in the outer core do not always coincide with reversals in the inner core. Both are required in order for Earth&#8217;s magnetic field to flip.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1822" style="width: 448px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/NASA_54559main_comparison1_strip.gif"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/NASA_54559main_comparison1_strip.gif" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1822" height="245" width="448" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.17</strong> Earth’s magnetic field between reversals (left) and during a reversal (right).

This means that tectonic plates are <em>floating</em> on the mantle, like a raft floating in the water, rather than <em>resting</em> on the mantle like a raft sitting on the ground. How high the lithosphere floats will depend on the balance between gravity pulling the lithosphere down, and the force of buoyancy as the mantle resists the downward motion of the lithosphere. <strong>Isostasy</strong> is the state in which the force of gravity pulling the plate toward Earth&#8217;s centre is balanced by the resistance of the mantle to letting the plate sink.</p> <p>To see how isostasy works, consider the rafts in Figure 3.18. The raft on the right is sitting on solid concrete. The raft will remain at the same elevation whether there are two people on it, or four, because the concrete is too strong to deform. In contrast, isostasy is in play for the rafts on the left, which are floating in a swimming pool full of peanut butter. With only one person on board, the raft floats high in the peanut butter, but with three people, it sinks dangerously low. Peanut butter, rather than water, is used in this example because the viscosity of peanut butter (its stiffness or resistance to flowing) more closely represents the relationship between the tectonic plates and the mantle. Although peanut butter has a similar density to water, it&#8217;s higher viscosity means that if a person is added to a raft, it will take longer for the raft to settle lower into the peanut butter that it would take the raft to sink into water.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1854" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE-1024x253.png" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1854" height="253" width="1024" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE-1024x253.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE-300x74.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE-768x190.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE-65x16.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE-225x56.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE-350x86.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_raft_SE.png 1425w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.18</strong> Illustration of isostatic relationships between rafts and peanut butter (left), and a non-isostatic relationship between a raft and solid ground (right). <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image041.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>The relationship of Earth’s crust to the mantle is similar to the relationship of the rafts to the peanut butter. The raft with one person on it floats comfortably high. Even with three people on it the raft is less dense than the peanut butter, so it floats, but it floats uncomfortably low for those three people. The crust, with an average density of around 2.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, is less dense than the mantle (average density of ~3.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup> near the surface, but more at depth), and so it is floating on the mantle. When weight is added to the crust through the process of mountain building, the crust slowly sinks deeper into the mantle, and the mantle material that was there is pushed aside (Figure 3.19, left). When erosion removes material from the mountains over tens of millions of years, decreasing the weight, the crust rebounds and the mantle rock flows back (Figure 3.19, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1827" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_rebound.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_rebound.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1827" height="321" width="720" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_rebound.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_rebound-300x134.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_rebound-65x29.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_rebound-225x100.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/isostasy_rebound-350x156.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.19</strong> Isostatic relationship between the crust and the mantle.

But will deform in a liquid manner if stress is applied slowly. The force of gravity applied over a period of hours can cause it to deform like a liquid, dripping through a hole in a glass tabletop (Figure 3.22). Similarly, the mantle will flow when placed under the slow but steady stress of a growing (or melting) ice sheet.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1835" style="width: 272px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Skiff_sillyputty.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Skiff_sillyputty.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1835" height="363" width="272" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Skiff_sillyputty.jpg 480w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Skiff_sillyputty-225x300.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Skiff_sillyputty-65x87.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Skiff_sillyputty-350x467.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 3.22</strong> Silly Putty exhibiting plastic behavior when acted upon by gravity over several hours. <em>Source: Erik Skiff (2006) CC BY-SA 2006 <a href="https://flic.kr/p/hdKDC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-3-summary-3rd" title="Chapter 3 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">20</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>3.1 Earth&#8217;s Layers</h3> <p>Earth is divided into a rocky crust and mantle, and a core consisting largely of iron. The crust and the uppermost mantle form the lithosphere, which is broken into tectonic plates.  The next layer, the asthenosphere, allows the plates to move because it deforms by flowing.</p> <h3>3.2 Imaging Earth&#8217;s Interior</h3> <p>Seismic waves that travel through Earth are either P-waves or S-waves. P-waves are faster than S-waves, and can pass through fluids. Earth&#8217;s layers can be identified by looking at changes in the velocity of seismic waves. Seismic wave shadow zones contributed to knowledge of the depth of the core-mantle boundary, and the knowledge that the outer core is liquid.  Plate tectonic structures within Earth can also be mapped using the seismic waves generated by earthquakes.</p> <h3>3.3 Earth&#8217;s Interior Heat</h3> <p>Earth’s temperature increases with depth (to around 6000°C at the centre), but the rate of increase is not the same everywhere. In the lithosphere, thickness and plate tectonic setting are are factors. Deeper within the mantle, convection currents are more important.</p> <h3>3.4 Earth&#8217;s Magnetic Field</h3> <p>Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is generated by convection of the liquid outer core. The magnetic field is similar to that of a bar magnet, and has force directions that vary with latitude. The polarity of the field is not constant, meaning that the positions of the north and south magnetic poles have flipped from “normal” (as it is now) to reversed and back many times in Earth&#8217;s history.</p> <h3>3.5 Isostasy</h3> <p>The plastic nature of the mantle, which allows for mantle convection, also determines the nature of the relationship between the crust and the mantle. The crust floats on the mantle in an isostatic relationship. Where the crust becomes thicker and heavier because of mountain building, it pushes farther down into the mantle. Oceanic crust, being denser than continental crust, floats lower on the mantle than continental crust.</p> <h2>Questions for Review</h2> <ol><li>What parts of Earth are most closely represented by typical stony meteorites and typical iron meteorites?</li> <li>Draw a simple diagram of Earth&#8217;s layers, and label the approximate locations of the following boundaries: crust/mantle, mantle/core, outer core/inner core.</li> <li>How do P-waves and S-waves differ?</li> <li>Why does P-wave velocity decrease dramatically at the core-mantle boundary?</li> <li>Why do both P-waves and S-waves gradually bend as they move through the mantle?</li> <li>What is the evidence for mantle convection, and what causes mantle convection?</li> <li>How is Earth’s magnetic field generated?</li> <li>When were the last two reversals of Earth’s magnetic field?</li> <li>What property of the mantle is essential for the isostatic relationship between the crust and the mantle?</li> <li>How would you expect the depth to the crust-mantle boundary in the area of the Rocky Mountains to differ from that in central Saskatchewan?</li> <li>British Columbia is still experiencing weak post-glacial isostatic uplift, especially in the interior, but also along the coast (<a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/rebound_rates_SE.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see Figure 3.21</a>). Meanwhile, offshore areas are experiencing weak isostatic subsidence. Why?</li> </ol> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-answers-to-chapter-3-review-questions" title="Answers to Chapter 3 Review Questions"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">21</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Answers to Chapter 3 Review Questions</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>1. Stony meteorites are similar in composition to Earth’s mantle, while iron meteorites are similar to the core.</p> <p>2. <a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/earth_interior.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compare your answer to Figure 3.4.</a></p> <p>3. P-waves can pass through a liquid, and travel approximately twice as fast as S-waves (which cannot pass through a liquid).</p> <p>4. P-wave velocity decreases at the core-mantle boundary because the outer core is liquid.</p> <p>5. The mantle gets increasingly dense and strong with depth because of the increasing pressure. This difference affects both P-wave and S-wave velocities, and they are refracted toward the lower density mantle material (meaning they are bent out toward Earth’s surface).</p> <p>6. The key evidence for mantle convection is that the rate of temperature increase with depth within the mantle is less than expected. This can only be explained by a mantle that is mixing by convection. The mechanism for convection is the transfer of heat from the core to the mantle, causing the to mantle flow.</p> <p>7. Earth’s magnetic field is generated within the liquid outer core because liquid metal is convecting.</p> <p>8. The last two reversals of Earth’s magnetic field were at the beginning of the present Brunhes normal chron (0.78 Ma), and at the end of the Jaramillo normal subchron (0.90 Ma). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#/media/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg"><br /> </a></p> <p>9. The isostatic relationship between the crust and the mantle is dependent on the fact that over very long timescales, the mantle deforms by flowing.</p> <p>10. In the area of the Rocky Mountains the crust is thickened and pushed down into the mantle. In Saskatchewan the crust is thinner and does not extend as far into the mantle.</p> <p>11. During the Pleistocene glaciation, British Columbia was pushed down by glacial ice. Mantle rock flowed slowly out from under the weighted-down crust and toward the ocean floor. Now that the land area is rebounding, that mantle rock is flowing back and the offshore areas are subsiding.</p> </div></div>

So… everything!</p> <p>The theory of plate tectonics was proposed to the geological community more than 100 years ago, so it may come as a surprise that an idea underpinning the study of Earth today did not become an accepted part of geology until the 1960s. It took many decades for this theory to become accepted for two main reasons. First, it was a radically different perspective on how Earth worked, and geologists were reluctant to entertain an idea that seemed preposterous in the context of the science of the day. The evidence and understanding of Earth that would have supported plate tectonic theory simply didn’t exist until the mid-twentieth century. Second, their opinion was affected by their view of the main proponent, Alfred Wegener. Wegener was not trained as a geologist, so he lacked credibility in the eyes of the geological community. Alfred Wegener was also German, whereas the geological establishment was centred in Britain and the United States- and Britain and the United States were at war with Germany in the first part of the 20th century.

He revised this book several times up to 1929. It was translated into French, English, Spanish, and Russian in 1924.</p> <p>The main criticism of Wegener&#8217;s idea was that he could not explain how continents could move. Remember that, as far as anyone was concerned, Earth&#8217;s crust was continuous, not broken into plates. Thus, any mechanism Wegener could think of would have to fit with that model of Earth&#8217;s structure. Geologists at the time were aware that continents were made of different rocks than the ocean crust, and that the material making up the continents was less dense, so Wegener proposed that the continents were like icebergs floating on the heavier ocean crust.  He suggested that the continents were moved by the effect of Earth&#8217;s rotation pushing objects toward the equator, and by the lunar and solar tidal forces, which tend to push objects toward the west. However, it was quickly shown that these forces were far too weak to move continents, and without any reasonable mechanism to make it work, Wegener’s theory was quickly dismissed by most geologists of the day.</p> <p>Alfred Wegener died in Greenland in 1930 while carrying out studies related to glaciation and climate. At the time of his death, his ideas were tentatively accepted by a small minority of geologists, and firmly rejected by most. But within a few decades that was all to change.</p> <h4>Resources</h4> <p><a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Wegener/wegener.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On The Shoulders of Giants: Alfred Wegener</a></p> <h4>References</h4> <p>Wegener, A.

One of those was explaining the distribution of terrestrial species across five continents that are currently separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres of ocean water, and another was explaining the origin of extensive fold-belt mountains, such as the Appalachians, the Alps, the Himalayas, and the Canadian Rockies.</p> <p>Before we continue, it is important to know what was generally believed about global geology before plate tectonics. At the beginning of the 20th century, geologists had a good understanding of how most rocks were formed and understood their relative ages through interpretation of fossils, but there was considerable controversy regarding the origin of mountain chains, especially fold-belt mountains. At the end of the 19th century, one of the prevailing views on the origin of mountains was the theory of <strong>contractionism</strong> — the idea that since Earth is slowly cooling, it must also be shrinking. In this scenario, mountain ranges had formed like the wrinkles on a dried-up apple. Oceans formed above parts of former continents that had settled downward and become submerged.</p> <p>While this hypothesis helped to address the dilemma of the terrestrial fossils by explaining how continents once connected could now be separated by oceans, it came with its own set of problems.&nbsp; One problem was that Earth wasn’t cooling fast enough to create the necessary amount of shrinking.&nbsp; Another problem was the principle of isostasy (already understood for several decades; see <a href="#chapter-3-5-isostasy-3rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 3.5</a> for a review of isostasy), which wouldn’t allow blocks of continental crust to sink in the way necessary for oceans to form in accordance with contractionist theory.</p> <p>Another widely held view was <strong>permanentism</strong>, the idea that the continents and oceans have always been generally the same as they are today. This view incorporated a mechanism for creation of mountain chains known as the <strong>geosyncline</strong> theory. A geosyncline is a thick (potentially 1000s of metres) deposit of sediments and sedimentary rocks, typically situated along the edge of a continent, and derived from continental weathering (Figure 4.6).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_542" style="width: 400px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0092.png"><img class="wp-image-542" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0092.png" alt="image" width="400" height="458" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.6</strong> The development of a geosyncline along a continental margin.

It was first proposed by James Hall and later elaborated upon by Dwight Dana, both of whom worked extensively in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. The process of converting a geosyncline into a mountain belt was believed to involve compression by forces pushing from either side, causing sedimentary layers within the geosyncline to fold up. In 1937, Philip Kuenen published a paper of experiments with layers of paraffin wax to test how this might work. He was able to cause layers within a geosyncline to fold up as the geosyncline deepened and became more tightly folded during the experiment (Figure 4.7).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2910" style="width: 522px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline.png"><img class="wp-image-2910" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline.png" alt="" width="522" height="405" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline-300x233.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline-768x596.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline-65x50.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline-225x175.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Kuenen_geosyncline-350x272.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.7</strong> Simulation of mountain building within a geosyncline using layers of wax.

Kuenen compressed the wax layers in his experiment by using pistons that pushed horizontally from either side, but described that mechanism as unrealistic. He explained that the pistons were just to get the process started within the experiment, and that in nature the main force was likely that of gravity pulling the geosyncline downward, drawing the sides together as it folded. When the sides were drawn together, this provided the compression to fold the sediments within the geosyncline. He couldn’t specify how the process got started in nature, but suggested that there could be a variety of reasons for an irregularity in the crust to respond to forces in such a way that would trigger downward sagging and folding.</p> <p>Proponents of the geosyncline theory of mountain formation—and there were many well into the 1960s—also had the problem of explaining the intercontinental terrestrial fossil matchups. The explanation offered was that land bridges had once linked the continents, permitting animals and plants to migrate back and forth. One proponent of this idea was the American naturalist Ernest Ingersoll. Referring to evidence of past climate changes, Ingersoll contributed the following to the 1918-20 edition of the <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em>:</p> <blockquote><p>The most interesting feature of these changes, however, is that by which, now and again, the Old World was connected with the New by necks or spaces of land, known as “land-bridges”; especially as these permitted an interchange of plants and animals, giving to us many new ones from the other side of the ocean, including, finally, man himself.</p></blockquote> <p>A problem with the land-bridge hypothesis is that there is no evidence of land bridges that could account for the fossil distribution patterns. The world’s oceans are approximately 4 km deep on average, so the underwater slopes leading up to a land bridge would have to have been at least 10s of km wide in most places, and many times that in others. Even if flooded, a land bridge of that size would still be visible in the shape of ocean-floor terrain.&nbsp; Isostasy would not permit such a land bridge to sink down without leaving a trace.</p> <p>We do know the locations of some past land bridges, but they were very different from the ones that would be required for this hypothesis. They are bridges such as the flooded Bering Strait land bridge, which is beneath only 30 to 50 m of water, and was exposed when sea levels were much lower because of water being locked in polar ice caps during the last major glaciation event.&nbsp; The narrowest point of the Bering Strait is 82 km wide. The shortest distance between South America and Africa is more than 2800 km.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercise: Fitting the Continents Together</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>The main continents around the Atlantic Ocean are shown in Figure 4.8 with the shapes that they might have had during the Mesozoic, including the extents of their continental shelves.

This would be like jamming your compass needle so that if you turned away from north, the needle would turn with you rather than continuing to point north.</p> <p>Rocks like basalt, which cool from a high temperature and commonly have relatively high levels of magnetite, are particularly susceptible to being magnetized in this way.&nbsp; However, even sediments and sedimentary rocks can take on remnant magnetism as long as they have small amounts of magnetic minerals, because the magnetic grains can gradually become lined up with Earth’s magnetic field as the sediments are deposited.</p> <p>By studying both the horizontal and vertical components of the remnant magnetism, one can tell not only the direction to magnetic north at the time of the rock’s formation, but also the latitude where the rock formed relative to magnetic north.&nbsp; Remember that the vertical component of the magnetic field points more sharply downward the closer it is to the magnetic north pole.&nbsp; Figure 4.9 shows the vertical component of remnant magnetism in a sequence of rocks.&nbsp; Notice that the arrow starts out at 500 Ma pointing slightly upward.&nbsp; This means that the rocks were in the southern hemisphere.&nbsp; As the rocks get younger, the arrow tilts toward horizontal, and then points downward.&nbsp; This indicates that the rocks were getting progressively closer to the north magnetic pole.</p> <h2>Apparent Polar Wandering Paths</h2> <p>In the early 1950s, a group of geologists from Cambridge University, including Keith Runcorn, Ted Irving,<span class="footnote">Ted Irving later set up a paleomagnetic lab at the Geological Survey of Canada in Sidney BC, and did important work on understanding the geology of western North America.</span>&nbsp;and several others, started looking at the remnant magnetism of Phanerozoic British and European volcanic rocks, and collecting <strong>paleomagnetic</strong> data. Using an analysis similar to that in Figure 4.9, they noticed that rocks of different ages sampled from the same general area showed very different magnetic pole positions (the green line in Figure 4.10). They assumed this meant that Earth’s magnetic pole had moved around significantly over time along <strong>polar wandering paths</strong>, rather than staying close to the geographic north pole as it does today.&nbsp; At the time, geophysical models suggested that the magnetic poles did not need to be aligned with the rotational poles, so this wasn’t an unreasonable conclusion, given what was known.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_544" style="width: 535px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0131.png"><img class="wp-image-544" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0131.png" alt="image" width="535" height="266" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.10</strong> Apparent polar-wandering paths (APWP) for Eurasia and North America.

In 1956, Runcorn became a proponent of continental drift.&nbsp; There was simply no other way to explain the data.</p> <p>This paleomagnetic work of the 1950s was the first new evidence in favour of continental drift, and it led a number of geologists to start thinking that the idea might have some merit. Nevertheless, for a majority of geologists, this type of evidence was not sufficiently convincing to get them to change their views.</p> <h1>Ocean Basin Geology and Geography</h1> <p>During the 20th century, our knowledge and understanding of the ocean basins and their geology increased dramatically. Before 1900 we knew virtually nothing about the bathymetry (the hills and valleys of the ocean floor) and geology of the oceans. By the end of the 1960s, we had detailed maps of the topography of the ocean floors, a clear picture of the geology of ocean floor sediments and the solid rocks beneath them, and almost as much information about the geophysical nature of ocean rocks as of continental rocks.</p> <h2>Acoustic Depth Sounding</h2> <p>Up until the 1920s, ocean depths were measured using weighted lines dropped overboard. In deep water this is a painfully slow process and the number of soundings in the deep oceans was probably fewer than 1,000. That is roughly one depth sounding for every 350,000 square kilometres of the ocean. To put that in perspective, it would be like trying to describe the topography of British Columbia with elevation data for only a half a dozen points!</p> <p>The voyage of the <em>Challenger</em> in 1872 and the laying of trans-Atlantic cables had shown that there were mountains beneath the seas, but most geologists and oceanographers still believed that the oceans were essentially vast basins with flat bottoms, filled with thousands of metres of sediments.</p> <p>Following development of acoustic depth sounders&nbsp;(Figure 4.11) in the 1920s, the number of depth readings increased by many orders of magnitude, and by the 1930s there was no doubt that major mountain chains ran through all of the world’s oceans. During and after World War II, there was a well-organized campaign to study the oceans, and by 1959, sufficient bathymetric data had been collected to produce detailed maps of all the oceans (Figure 4.12).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_546" style="width: 448px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0171.png"><img class="wp-image-546" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0171.png" alt="image" width="448" height="204" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.11</strong> A ship-borne acoustic depth sounder.

Bullard and colleagues found higher than average heat-flow rates along the ridges, and lower than average rates in trenches. These data were interpreted as evidence of mantle convection, with areas of high heat flow corresponding to upward convection of hot mantle material, and areas of low heat flow corresponding to downward convection.</p> <h2>Earthquake Belts</h2> <p>With developments of networks of seismographic stations in the 1950s, it became possible to plot the locations <em>and</em> depths of both major and minor earthquakes with great accuracy. A remarkable correspondence was observed between earthquake locations and both the mid-ocean ridges and the deep ocean trenches. In 1954 Gutenberg and Richter showed that the ocean-ridge earthquakes were all relatively shallow, and confirmed what had first been shown by Benioff in the 1930s, that earthquakes in the vicinity of ocean trenches were both shallow and deep, but that the deeper ones were situated progressively farther inland from the trenches (Figure 4.15).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_551" style="width: 686px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0251.png"><img class="wp-image-551" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0251.png" alt="image" width="686" height="168" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.15</strong> Aleutian Island subduction zone earthquakes.

The first comprehensive magnetic data set was compiled in 1958 for an area off the coasts of BC and Washington State. This survey revealed a bewildering pattern of low and high magnetic field intensity in sea-floor rocks (Figure 4.16). When the data were first plotted on a map in 1961, nobody understood them — not even the scientists who collected them. Many 1000s of km of magnetic surveys were conducted over the next several years.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_121" style="width: 255px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=121" rel="attachment wp-att-121"><img class="size-full wp-image-121" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0271.png" alt="" width="255" height="222" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0271.png 255w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0271-65x57.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0271-225x196.png 225w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.16</strong> Pattern of sea-floor magnetic field intensity off the west coast of British Columbia and Washington.

In 1960, Harold Hess from Princeton University, advanced a hypothesis with many of the elements that we now accept as <strong>plate tectonics</strong>. He maintained some uncertainty about his proposal however, and in order to deflect criticism from mainstream geologists, he labelled it “geopoetry.” In fact, until 1962, Hess didn’t even put his ideas in writing — except internally to the U.S. Navy (which funded his research) — but presented them mostly in lectures and seminars.</p> <p>Hess proposed that new sea floor was generated from mantle material at the ocean ridges, and that old sea floor was dragged down at the ocean trenches and re-incorporated into the mantle. He suggested that the process was driven by mantle convection currents, rising at the ridges and descending at the trenches (Figure 4.17). He also suggested that the less-dense continental crust did not descend with oceanic crust into trenches, but that colliding landmasses were thrust up to form mountains.</p> <p>Hess’s hypotheses formed the basis for our ideas on <strong>sea-floor spreading</strong> and <strong>continental drift,</strong> but did not go so far as to claim that the crust is made up of separate plates. The Hess model was not roundly criticized, but also not widely accepted, partly because evidence was still lacking.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_553" style="width: 533px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0291.png"><img class="wp-image-553" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0291.png" alt="image" width="533" height="212" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.17</strong> A representation of Harold Hess’s model for sea-floor spreading and subduction. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0291.png">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Collection of magnetic data from the oceans continued in the early 1960s, but the striped patterns remained unexplained. Some assumed that, as with continental crust, the stripes were related to compositional variations in rock, such as variations in the amount of magnetite. The first real understanding of the significance of the striped anomalies was the interpretation by Fred Vine, a Cambridge graduate student. Vine was examining magnetic data from the Indian Ocean and, like others before him, noted that the magnetic patterns were symmetrical on either side of the ridge.</p> <p>At the same time, other researchers led by groups in California and New Zealand were studying the phenomenon of reversals in Earth’s magnetic field. They were trying to determine when such reversals had taken place over the past several million years by analyzing the magnetic characteristics of hundreds of samples from basaltic flows. As discussed in Chapter 3, Earth’s magnetic field periodically weakens, then becomes virtually non-existent before becoming re-established with the reverse polarity. During periods of reversed polarity, a compass would point south instead of north.</p> <p>The time scale of magnetic reversals is irregular. The present “normal” event, known as the Bruhnes magnetic chron, has persisted for about 780,000 years. It was preceded by a 190,000-year reversed event; a 50,000-year normal event known as Jaramillo; and then a 700,000-year reversed event (<a href="#chapter-3-4-earths-magnetic-field-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see Figure 3.16</a>).</p> <p>In a paper published in September 1963, Vine and his PhD supervisor Drummond Matthews proposed that the patterns associated with ridges were related to the magnetic reversals, and that oceanic crust created from cooling basalt during a <em>normal</em> event would have polarity aligned with the present magnetic field, and would produce a positive anomaly (a black stripe on the sea-floor magnetic map). Oceanic crust created during a <em>reversed</em> event would have polarity opposite Earth’s present field and thus produce a negative magnetic anomaly (a white stripe). The same idea had been put forward a few months earlier by Lawrence Morley, of the Geological Survey of Canada. However, Morley’s papers submitted earlier in 1963 to <em>Nature</em> and <em>The Journal of Geophysical Research</em> were rejected. The idea is sometimes referred to as the Vine-Matthews-Morley (VMM) hypothesis.</p> <p>Vine, Matthews, and Morley were the first to show this type of correspondence between the relative widths of the stripes and the durations of the magnetic reversals. The VMM hypothesis was confirmed within a few years when magnetic data were compiled from spreading ridges around the world. It was shown that the same general magnetic patterns were present straddling each ridge, although the widths of the anomalies varied according to the spreading rates characteristic of the different ridges. It was also shown that the patterns corresponded with the known timeline of Earth’s magnetic field reversals.</p> <p>In 1963, J. Tuzo Wilson of the University of Toronto proposed the idea of a <strong>mantle plume</strong> or <strong>hot spot </strong>— a place where hot mantle material rises in a stationary and semi-permanent plume, and affects the overlying crust. He based this hypothesis partly on the distribution of the Hawai’ian and Emperor Seamount island chains in the Pacific Ocean (Figure 4.18). The volcanic rock making up these islands becomes progressively younger toward the southeast, culminating in the island of Hawai’i itself, which consists of rock that is almost all younger than 1 Ma.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 574px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0312.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0312.png" alt="Ages of the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamounts in relation to the location of the Hawaiian mantle plume.

Near the Midway Islands, the chain makes a pronounced change in direction, from northwest-southeast for the Hawai’ian Islands, to nearly north-south for the Emperor Seamounts. This change has been ascribed to a change in direction of the Pacific Plate moving over the stationary mantle plume. An alternative hypothesis is that rather than the Pacific Plate having undergone a sudden change in motion, the plume itself has moved at least 2,000 km south over the period between 81 and 45 Ma (Tarduno et al., 2003).</p> <p>There is evidence of many such mantle plumes around the world (Figure 4.19). Most are within ocean basins, including places like Hawai’i, Iceland, and the Galapagos Islands, but some are under continents. One example is the Yellowstone hot spot in the west-central United States, and another is the one responsible for the Anahim Volcanic Belt in central British Columbia. It is evident that mantle plumes are very long-lived phenomena, lasting for at least tens of millions of years, and possibly for hundreds of millions of years in some cases.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_556" style="width: 565px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image035.jpg"><img class="wp-image-556" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image035.jpg" alt="image" width="565" height="350" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.19</strong> Mantle plume locations.&nbsp; Selected Mantle plumes: 1: Azores, 3: Bowie, 5: Cobb, 8: Eifel, 10: Galapagos, 12: Hawai’i, 14: Iceland, 17: Cameroon, 18: Canary, 19: Cape Verde, 35: Samoa, 38: Tahiti, 42: Tristan, 44: Yellowstone, 45: Anahim. <em>Source: Ingo Wölbern (2007) Public Domain <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hotspots.jpg">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Oceanic spreading ridges appear to be curved features on Earth’s surface, but the ridges are in fact composed of a series of straight-line segments, offset at intervals by faults perpendicular to the ridge (Figure 4.20).

The major plates are Eurasian, Pacific, Indian, Australian, North American, South American, African, and Antarctic plates. There are also numerous small plates (e.g., Juan de Fuca, Nazca, Scotia, Philippine, Caribbean), and many very small plates or sub-plates. The Juan de Fuca Plate is actually three separate plates (Gorda, Juan de Fuca, and Explorer), all moving in the same general direction but at slightly different rates.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 672px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Plate_tectonics_map.gif"><img class="" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Plate_tectonics_map.gif" alt="Figure 4.18 A detailed map of Earth's tectonic plates.

Rates of motions of the major plates range from less than 1 cm/y to more than 10 cm/y. The Pacific Plate is the fastest, moving at more than 10 cm/y in some areas, followed by the Australian and Nazca Plates. The North American Plate is one of the slowest, averaging ~1 cm/y in the south up to almost 4 cm/y in the north.</p> <p>Plates move as rigid bodies, so it may seem surprising that the North American Plate can be moving at different rates in different places. The explanation is that plates rotate as they move; the North American Plate, for example, rotates counter-clockwise, while the Eurasian Plate rotates clockwise.</p> <p>Boundaries between the plates are of three types: <strong>divergent (</strong>moving apart)<em>, </em><strong>convergent </strong>(moving together), and <strong>transform </strong>(moving side by side). The plates are made up of crust and lithospheric mantle (Figure 4.24). Even though the plates are in constant motion, and move in different directions, there is never a significant amount of space between them. Plates move along the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, because the asthenosphere is relatively weak. It deforms as the plates move, rather than locking them in place.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_579" style="width: 595px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image045_2.png"><img class="wp-image-579" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image045_2.png" alt="image" width="595" height="272" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.24</strong> The crust and upper mantle.

The upward convective motion of hot mantle material generates temperatures that are too high for the existence of a significant thickness of rigid lithosphere at the same time that the plates are falling away from each other (<a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0291.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figure 4.17</a>).</p> <p>The fact that plates include both crustal material and lithospheric mantle material makes it possible for a single plate to be include both oceanic and continental crust. The North American Plate includes most of North America, plus half of the northern Atlantic Ocean. Similarly the South American Plate extends across the western part of the southern Atlantic Ocean, while the European and African plates each include part of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Plate is almost entirely oceanic, but it does include the part of California west of the San Andreas Fault.</p> <h1>Divergent Boundaries</h1> <p>Divergent boundaries are spreading boundaries, where new oceanic crust is created from magma derived from partial melting of the mantle. The partial melting happens when hot mantle rock is moved from deep within Earth where pressures are too high for it to be liquid, to shallower depths where the pressure is much lower (Figure 4.25, bottom left).</p> <p>The triangular zone of partial melting near the ridge crest is approximately 60 km thick and the proportion of magma is about 10% of the rock volume, thus producing crust that is about 6 km thick once the melt escapes from the rock in which it formed, and ascends. Most divergent boundaries are located in the oceans, and the crustal material created at a spreading boundary is always oceanic in character; in other words, it is mafic igneous rock (basalt or gabbro, with minerals rich in iron and magnesium). Spreading rates vary considerably, from 1 cm/y to 3 cm/y in the Atlantic, to between 6 cm/y and 10 cm/y in the Pacific. Some of the processes taking place in this setting include (Figure 4.25, top):</p> <ul><li>Melted rock (magma) from the mantle rising up to fill the voids left by divergence of the two plates</li> <li><strong>Pillow lavas</strong> forming where melted rock emerges on the ocean floor and is cooled by seawater (Figure 4.25, bottom right)</li> <li>Vertical sheeted dykes intruding into cracks resulting from the spreading</li> <li>Magma cooling more slowly in the lower part of the new crust, forming bodies of gabbro</li> </ul> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1883" style="width: 992px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/divergent-boundary-processes.png"><img class="wp-image-1883 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/divergent-boundary-processes.png" alt="image" width="992" height="880" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.25</strong> Divergent boundary.

This type of valley may eventually develop into a linear sea (such as the present-day Red Sea), and finally into an ocean (such as the Atlantic). It is likely that as many as 20 mantle plumes, many of which still exist, were responsible for the initiation of the rifting of Pangea along what is now the mid-Atlantic ridge (see the Atlantic Ocean mantle plume locations in <a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image035.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figure 4.19</a>).</p> <h1>Convergent Boundaries</h1> <p>Convergent boundaries, where two plates are moving toward each other, are of three types, depending on whether ocean or continental crust is present on either side of the boundary. The types are ocean-ocean, ocean-continent, and continent-continent.</p> <h2>Ocean-Ocean Convergent Boundaries</h2> <p>At an ocean-ocean convergent boundary, a plate margin consisting of oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle is <strong>subducted</strong><em>, </em>or travels beneath, the margin of the plate with which it is colliding (Figure 4.27). Often it is the older and colder plate that is denser and subducts beneath the younger and hotter plate. Ocean trenches commonly form along these boundaries.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_564" style="width: 499px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0551.png"><img class="wp-image-564" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0551.png" alt="image" width="499" height="231" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.27</strong> Configuration and processes of an ocean-ocean convergent boundary <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0551.png">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>As the subducting crust is heated and the pressure increases, water is released from within the subducting material. This water comes primarily from alteration of the minerals pyroxene and olivine to serpentine near the spreading ridge shortly after the rock’s formation. The water mixes with the overlying mantle, which lowers the melting point of mantle rocks, causing magma to form. This process is called <strong>flux melting</strong> or <strong>fluid-induced melting</strong>.</p> <p>The newly produced magma, which is lighter than the surrounding mantle rocks, rises through the mantle and sometimes through the overlying oceanic crust to the ocean floor where it creates a chain of volcanic islands known as an island arc. A mature island arc develops into a chain of relatively large islands (such as Japan or Indonesia) as more and more volcanic material is extruded and sedimentary rocks accumulate around the islands. The largest earthquakes occur near the surface where the subducting plate is still cold and strong.</p> <p>Examples of ocean-ocean convergent zones are subduction of the Pacific Plate south of Alaska (Aleutian Islands) and west of the Philippines, subduction of the Indian Plate south of Indonesia, and subduction of the Atlantic Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate.</p> <h2>Ocean-Continent Convergent Boundaries</h2> <p>At an ocean-continent convergent boundary, the oceanic plate is subducted beneath the continental plate in the same manner as at an ocean-ocean boundary. Rocks and sediment on the continental slope are thrust up into an <strong>accretionary wedge</strong>, and compression leads to faults forming within the continental plate (Figure 4.28). The mafic magma produced adjacent to the subduction zone rises to the base of the continental crust and leads to partial melting of the crustal rock. The resulting magma ascends through the crust, producing a mountain chain with many volcanoes.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2942" style="width: 506px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent.png"><img class="wp-image-2942" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent.png" alt="" width="506" height="262" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent-300x156.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent-768x398.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent-65x34.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent-225x117.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ocean-continent-350x181.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.28</strong> Configuration and processes of an ocean-continent convergent boundary Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0, modified after Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0572.png">view source</a></div></div> <p>Examples of ocean-continent convergent boundaries are subduction of the Nazca Plate under South America (which has created the Andes Range) and subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under North America (creating the mountains Garibaldi, Baker, St. Helens, Rainier, Hood, and Shasta, collectively known as the Cascade Range).</p> <h2>Continent-Continent Convergent Boundary</h2> <p>A continent-continent collision occurs when a continent or large island that has been moved along with subducting oceanic crust collides with another continent (Figure 4.29). The colliding continental material will not be subducted because it is not dense enough, but the root of the oceanic plate will eventually break off and sink into the mantle. There is tremendous deformation of the pre-existing continental rocks, and creation of mountains from that rock, as well as from any sediments that had accumulated along the shores of both continental masses, and commonly also from some ocean crust and upper mantle material.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_566" style="width: 400px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0591.png"><img class="wp-image-566" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image0591.png" alt="image" width="400" height="168" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.29</strong> Configuration and processes of a continent-continent convergent boundary <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 </em><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0591.png"><em>view source</em></a></div></div> <p>Examples of continent-continent convergent boundaries are the collision of the India Plate with the Eurasian Plate, creating the Himalaya Mountains, and the collision of the African Plate with the Eurasian Plate, creating the series of ranges extending from the Alps in Europe to the Zagros Mountains in Iran.</p> <p>When a subduction zone is jammed shut by a continent-continent collision, plate tectonic stresses that are still present can sometimes cause a new subduction zone to develop outboard of the colliding plate.</p> <h1>Transform Boundaries</h1> <p>Transform boundaries exist where one plate slides past another without producing or destroying crust, except in the special case where the transform boundary has bends and jogs.

An example is the San Andreas Fault, which connects the southern end of the Juan de Fuca Ridge with the northern end of the East Pacific Rise (a ridge) in the Gulf of California (Figures 4.30 and 4.31). The part of California west of the San Andreas Fault and all of Baja California are on the Pacific Plate.

Incipient rifting has begun along the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa, extending from Ethiopia and Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden (Red Sea) all the way south to Malawi.</p> <p>Pangea was not the first supercontinent. It was preceded by Pannotia (600 to 540 Ma), Rodinia (1,100 to 750 Ma), and by others before that. In fact, in 1966, Tuzo Wilson proposed that supercontinents are part of an on-going cycle, which we now refer to as a <strong>Wilson cycle</strong>. In a Wilson cycle, continents break up, and fragments drift apart only to collide again and make a new continent.</p> <p>At present we are in the stages of a Wilson cycle where fragments are drifting and changing their configuration. North and South America, Europe, and Africa are moving with their respective portions of the Atlantic Ocean. The eastern margins of North and South America and the western margins of Europe and Africa are called passive margins because there is no subduction taking place along them. Because the oceanic crust formed by spreading along the mid-Atlantic ridge is not currently being subducted (except in the Caribbean), the Atlantic Ocean is slowly getting bigger, and the Pacific Ocean is getting smaller.</p> <p>This situation may not continue for too much longer, however. As the Atlantic Ocean floor gets weighed down around its margins by great thickness of continental sediments, it will be pushed farther and farther into the mantle, and eventually the oceanic lithosphere may break away from the continental lithosphere and begin to subduct (Figure 4.34).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_570" style="width: 400px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image067.png"><img class="wp-image-570" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image067.png" alt="image067" width="400" height="352" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.34</strong> Development of a subduction zone at a passive margin.

Once this happens, the continents will no longer continue to move apart because the spreading at the mid-Atlantic ridge will be taken up by subduction. If spreading along the mid-Atlantic ridge continues to be slower than spreading within the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean will start to close up, and eventually (in a 100 million years or more) North and South America will collide again with Europe and Africa.

There are roots of ancient mountain belts along the eastern margin of North America, the western margin of Europe, and the north-western margin of Africa, which show that these landmasses once collided with each other to form a mountain chain. The mountain chain might have been as big as the Himalayas.</p> <p>The apparent line of collision runs between Norway and Sweden, between Scotland and England, through Ireland, through Newfoundland and the Maritimes, through the north-eastern and eastern states, and across the northern end of Florida. When rifting of Pangea started at approximately 200 Ma, the fissuring was along a different line from the line of the earlier collision. This is why some of the mountain chains formed during the earlier collision can be traced from Europe to North America and from Europe to Africa.</p> <p>It is probably no coincidence that the Atlantic Ocean rift may have occurred in approximately the same place during two separate events several hundred million years apart. The series of hot spots that has been identified in the Atlantic Ocean may also have existed for several hundred million years, and thus may have contributed to rifting in roughly the same place on at least two separate occasions (Figure 4.36).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_536" style="width: 400px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image081.png"><img class="wp-image-536" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Wilson-cycle.png" alt="Wilson cycle" width="400" height="314" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 4.36</strong> A scenario for the Wilson cycle.

By the mid-1960s, the fundamentals of the theory of plate tectonics were in place.</p> <h3>4.4 Plates, Plate Motions, and Plate-Boundary Processes</h3> <p>Earth’s lithosphere is made up of over 20 plates that are moving in different directions at rates of between 1 cm/y to greater than 10 cm/y. The three types of plate boundaries are divergent (plates moving apart and new crust forming), convergent (plates moving together and one possibly being subducted), and transform (plates moving side by side). Divergent boundaries form where existing plates are rifted apart, and it is hypothesized that this is caused by a series of mantle plumes. Subduction zones can form where accumulation of sediment at a passive margin leads to separation of oceanic and continental lithosphere. Supercontinents form and break up through these processes.</p> <h3>4.5 Mechanisms for Plate Motion</h3> <p>It is widely believed that ridge-push and slab-pull are the main mechanisms for plate motion, as opposed to traction by mantle convection. Mantle convection is a key factor for producing the conditions necessary for ridge-push and slab-pull.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>List some of the evidence used by Wegener to support his idea of moving continents.</li> <li>What was the primary weakness in Wegener’s continental drift hypothesis?</li> <li>How were mountains thought to be formed (a) by contractionists and (b) by permanentists?</li> <li>How were the trans-Atlantic paleontological matchups explained in the late 19th century?</li> <li>How did we learn about the topography of the sea floor in the early part of the 20th century?</li> <li>What evidence from paleomagnetic studies provided support for continental drift?</li> <li>Which parts of the oceans are the deepest?</li> <li>Why is there less sediment along ocean ridges than on other parts of the sea floor?</li> <li>How were the oceanic heat-flow data related to mantle convection?</li> <li>Describe the spatial distribution of earthquakes at ocean ridges and ocean trenches.</li> <li>In the model for ocean basins developed by Harold Hess, what happens at oceanic ridges and what happens at oceanic trenches?</li> <li>What aspect of plate tectonics was not included in the Hess model?</li> <li>What is a mantle plume and what is its expected lifespan?</li> <li>Describe the nature of movement at an ocean ridge transform fault (a) between the ridge segments, and (b) outside of ridge segments.</li> <li>How is it possible for a plate to include both oceanic and continental crust?</li> <li>What is the likely relationship between mantle plumes and the development of a continental rift?</li> <li>Why does subduction not take place at a continent-continent convergence zone?</li> <li>Where are Earth’s most recent sites of continental rifting and creation of new ocean floor?</li> <li>What geological situation might eventually lead to the generation of a subduction zone at a passive ocean-continent boundary such as the eastern coast of North America?</li> </ol> </div></div>

Permanentists believed that mountains formed by the geosynclinal process.</li> <li>In the late 19th century the trans-Atlantic paleontological matchups were explained by assuming that there must have been land bridges between the continents at some time in the past.</li> <li>Prior to 1920, ocean depths were measured by dropping a weighted line over the side of ship. Echo sounding techniques were developed at around that time and greatly facilitated the measurement of ocean depths.</li> <li>Paleomagnetic studies showed that old rocks on the continents indicated different locations for magnetic north than the position of magnetic north today. They also showed that the difference in pole position from data on different continents increased progressively for older and older rocks. This implied that either Earth had more than one magnetic pole moving around, or that the continents had moved.</li> <li>Trenches associated with subduction zones are the deepest parts of the oceans.</li> <li>The ocean ridge areas are the youngest parts of the sea floor and thus there hasn’t been time for much sediment to accumulate.</li> <li>It was (and still is) thought that high heat flow exists where mantle convection cells are moving hot rock from the lower mantle toward the surface, and that low heat flow exists where there is downward movement of mantle rock.</li> <li>Earthquakes are consistently shallow and relatively small at ocean ridges. At ocean trenches earthquakes become increasingly deep in the direction that the subducting plate is moving.</li> <li>In the Hess model new crust was formed at ocean ridges. Crust was recycled back into the mantle at the trenches.</li> <li>Hess’s model did not include the concept of tectonic plates.</li> <li>A mantle plume is a column of hot rock (not magma) that ascends toward the surface from the lower mantle. Mantle plumes last tens of millions of years to hundreds of millions of years.</li> <li>(a) Between the ridge segments there is movement in opposite directions along a transform fault. (b) Outside of the ridge segments the two plates are moving in the same direction and likely at about the same rate. These regions are known as fracture zones.</li> <li>Tectonic plates are made up of crust and the lithospheric (rigid) part of the underlying mantle. The mantle part ensures that the very different oceanic and continental crust sections of a plate can act as one unit.</li> <li>A mantle plume beneath a continent can cause the crust to form a dome that might eventually split open. Several mantle plumes along a line within a continent could lead to rifting.</li> <li>Subduction does not take place at a continent-continent convergent zone because neither plate is dense enough to sink into the mantle.</li> <li>Continental rifting is taking place along the East Africa Rift, and sea floor has recently been created in the Red Sea and also in the Gulf of California.</li> <li>The accumulation of sediment at a passive ocean-continent boundary will lead to the depression of the lithosphere and could eventually result in the separation of the oceanic and continental parts of the plate and the beginning of subduction.</li> </ol> </div></div>

Minerals can be found in a wide variety of consumer products such as paper, medicine, processed foods, and cosmetics. And of course, everything made of metal is also derived from minerals.</p> <p>A <strong>mineral</strong> is a naturally occurring solid made of specific elements, and arranged in a particular repeating three-dimensional structure.</p> <p>“Naturally occurring” means that minerals can be formed from substances and under conditions found in nature. Substances that can only be made by humans—classified as <strong>anthropogenic</strong> materials—do not count as minerals, nor do substances produced by natural processes acting upon anthropogenic materials.</p> <p>In the context of the definition of minerals, “solid” means solid at 25ºC. There are some exceptions to this rule, made for substances defined as minerals before 1959, prior to strict procedures being established for determining what is or isn’t a mineral. One example is ice, which is only solid at or below 0 °C. Another is mercury, which is solid below -39 ºC. Mercury that is present in rocks at temperatures above -39 ºC appears as silvery blobs of liquid (Figure 5.2).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1865" style="width: 552px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-1865" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3-1024x613.jpeg" alt="" width="552" height="331" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3-1024x613.jpeg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3-300x180.jpeg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3-768x460.jpeg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3-65x39.jpeg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3-225x135.jpeg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3-350x209.jpeg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Mercure_cinabre_3.jpeg 1464w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.2</strong> Droplets of native mercury (pure mercury, Hg), also called quicksilver, amid waxy red crystals of cinnabar (HgS).

The mineral pyrite, for example, is FeS<sub>2</sub> (two atoms of sulphur for each atom of iron), and any significant departure from that formula would make it a different mineral. Some minerals can have variable compositions within a specific range. The mineral olivine, for example, has a formula written as (Fe,Mg)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, because the composition of olivine can range all the way from Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> to Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>,<sub>&nbsp; </sub>and have any proportion of iron and magnesium in between. This type of substitution is known as <strong>solid solution</strong>.</p> <p>Most important of all, the atoms within a mineral are arranged in a specific repeating three-dimensional structure or <strong>lattice</strong>. This regular structure means that all minerals are <strong>crystals</strong>. The mineral <strong>halite</strong>, which we use as table salt, has a relatively simple crystal lattice (Figure 5.3). Atoms of sodium (Na, purple) alternate with atoms of chlorine (Cl, green). The chemical bonds holding the Na and Cl atoms together are all at 90º to each other. Even tiny crystals, like the ones in your salt shaker, have lattices that extend in three dimensions for thousands of repetitions. Halite will always have this structure, and will always have the formula NaCl.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1867" style="width: 321px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite.png"><img class="wp-image-1867" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-1024x865.png" alt="" width="321" height="271" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-1024x865.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-300x253.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-768x649.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-65x55.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-225x190.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-350x296.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite.png 1260w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.3</strong> Halite crystal lattice.

Protons have a positive charge, neutrons have no charge, and electrons have a negative charge. Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, but electrons have a mass that is 10,000 times smaller.</p> <p>The element hydrogen (H) has the simplest atoms. Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton and one electron. The proton forms the <strong>nucleus</strong> (the centre of the atom), while the electron orbits around it (Figure 5.5, left). All other elements have more than one proton in their nucleus. Protons repel each other because they are positively charged, but it is possible to have more than one proton in a nucleus because neutrons hold them together. The next most complex atom, helium (He) has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus, in its most common form. Some atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons. For example, forms of hydrogen exist with one and two neutrons, and a tiny fraction of He atoms have only one neutron. Forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called <strong>isotopes</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1869" style="width: 648px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_H_He.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_H_He.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1869" width="648" height="326" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_H_He.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_H_He-300x151.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_H_He-65x33.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_H_He-225x113.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_H_He-350x176.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.5</strong> Atomic structure of hydrogen and helium showing protons (p+), neutrons (n), and electrons (e-). <em>Source: Bruce Blaus (2014) CC BY 3.0 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>The number of protons in an atom determines what element it will be, so the number of protons is called the <strong>atomic number </strong>of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is the <strong>mass number</strong>. The mass number distinguishes between isotopes of an element. Isotopes of an element are denoted by putting the mass number as a subscript in front of the symbol for that element. For example, the isotopes of hydrogen are <sup>1</sup>H (1 proton), <sup>2</sup>H (1 proton + 1 neutron), and <sup>3</sup>H (1 proton + 2 neutrons).</p> <p>For most of the 16 lightest elements (up to oxygen) the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons. For most of the remaining elements, there are more neutrons than protons. This is because the more protons that are concentrated in a small space, the more neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus together.  The most common isotope of uranium (U), for example, is <sup>238</sup>U. It has 92 protons, but requires 146 neutrons to keep them together.  The neutrons are only partly successful.  Uranium is radioactive, meaning that its nucleus will eventually split apart and release energy. What remains of the nucleus has fewer protons, so after decay the atom is a different element.</p> <h1>Electrons Are What Control How Atoms Interact</h1> <p>Electrons orbiting around the nucleus of an atom are arranged in shells (also called <strong>energy levels</strong>). The first shell can hold only two electrons (as in H and He in Figure 5.5), but the next shell holds up to eight electrons. An atom can have many shells of electrons, but there are never more than 8 outermost electrons interacting with surrounding atoms.</p> <p>The outermost electrons determine how atoms can be bonded together. Elements that have a full outer shell (e.g., neon, Figure 5.6 right)  are <strong>inert</strong> because they do not react with other elements to form compounds. These are the <strong>noble gases</strong> (including helium, argon, krypton, and radon, in addition to neon) in the far-right column of the periodic table. For elements that do not have a full outer shell (e.g., lithium, Figure 5.6 left), the outermost electrons can interact with the outermost electrons of nearby atoms to create chemical bonds.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1877" style="width: 648px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_LiNe.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_LiNe.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1877" width="648" height="325" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_LiNe.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_LiNe-300x150.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_LiNe-65x33.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_LiNe-225x113.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Blausen_0342_ElectronEnergyLevels_LiNe-350x176.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.6</strong> The number of electrons in an atom&#8217;s outermost shell (or energy level) determine whether it will bond to other atoms, and how it will bond.

Consider the mineral graphite (Figure 5.11, right): the carbon atoms are linked together in sheets or layers in which each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three others. Graphite-based compounds are strong because of the covalent bonding between carbon atoms within each layer, which is why they are used in high-end sports equipment such as ultralight racing bicycles. Graphite itself is soft, however, because the layers themselves are held together by relatively weak <strong>Van der Waals forces</strong>.  </p> <p>Van der Waals forces, like <strong>hydrogen bonds</strong>, work because molecules can be electrostatically neutral, but still have an end that is slightly more positive and an end that is slightly more negative. In water molecules (Figure 5.12, left), the bent shape puts the hydrogen atoms on one side of the molecule, and the oxygen atom, with more electrons, on the other. The charge is distributed asymmetrically across the water molecule. Contrast this with the straight carbon dioxide (Figure 5.12, right) molecule. The slightly more negative oxygen atoms on the ends are distributed symmetrically on either side of the carbon atom.   </p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1899" style="width: 455px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1899" width="455" height="325" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding-300x214.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding-768x548.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding-65x46.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding-225x161.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/hydrogen_bonding-350x250.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.12</strong> Hydrogen bonding.

Hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is an oxide; that’s easy, but anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) is a sulphate because SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup> is the anion, not O. Similarly, calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is a carbonate, and olivine (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) is a silicate. Minerals with only one element (such as S) are native minerals, while those with an anion from the halogen column of the periodic table (Cl, F, Br, etc.) are halides. Provide group names for the following minerals:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Mineral</strong></td> <td><strong>Formula</strong></td> <td><strong>Group</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>sphalerite</td> <td>ZnS</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>magnetite</td> <td>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>pyroxene</td> <td>MgSiO<sub>3</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>anglesite</td> <td>PbSO<sub>4</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>sylvite</td> <td>KCl</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>silver</td> <td>Ag</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>fluorite</td> <td>CaF<sub>2</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>ilmenite</td> <td>FeTiO<sub>3</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>siderite</td> <td>FeCO<sub>3</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>feldspar</td> <td>KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>sulphur</td> <td>S</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><td>xenotime</td> <td>YPO<sub>4</sub></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div></div>

Depending on the temperature and rate of cooling, K-feldspar can occur as one of three polymorphs: <strong>orthoclase</strong>, <strong>sanidine</strong>, or <strong>microcline</strong>.&nbsp; Another end member is <strong>albite</strong>, which has sodium instead of potassium (formula NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>).&nbsp;As is the case for iron and magnesium in olivine, there is a continuous range of compositions (referred to as a solid-solution series) between albite and orthoclase. Feldspars in this series are referred to as <strong>alkali feldspars</strong>. Potassium cations are much larger than sodium cations (1.37 Å versus 0.99 Å, respectively), so high temperatures are required to form alkali feldspars with intermediate compositions.</p> <p>The third end-member is <strong>anorthite </strong>and it has calcium instead of potassium or sodium (formula CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>). Feldspars in the solid-solution series between albite and anorthite are called <strong>plagioclase feldspars</strong>. Calcium and sodium cations are nearly the same size (1.00 Å and 0.99 Å, respectively), so from that perspective it makes sense that they substitute readily for each other, and that any intermediate compositions between CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> can exist. However, calcium and sodium ions don’t have the same charge (Ca<sup>2+</sup> versus Na+), making it surprising that they substitute so easily. The difference in charge is accommodated by substituting some Al<sup>3+</sup> for Si<sup>4+</sup>.&nbsp; Albite has one Al and three Si in its formula, while anorthite is has two Al and two Si.&nbsp; Plagioclase feldspars of intermediate composition also have intermediate proportions of Al and Si.</p> <h2>Quartz</h2> <p><strong>Quartz</strong> (SiO<sub>2</sub>; Figure 5.29) contains only silica tetrahedra. In quartz<strong>,</strong> each silica tetrahedron is bonded to four other tetrahedra (with an oxygen shared at every corner of each tetrahedron), making a three-dimensional framework.&nbsp; As a result, the ratio of silicon to oxygen is 1:2. Because the one silicon cation has a +4 charge and the two oxygen anions each have a –2 charge, the charge is balanced. There is no need to add cations to balance the charge. The hardness of quartz and the fact that it breaks irregularly (notice the bottom of the crystal in Figure 5.29 right) and not along smooth planes result from the strong covalent/ionic bonds characteristic of the silica tetrahedron.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1980" style="width: 500px"><a href="#chapter-5-4-silicate-minerals-2" rel="attachment wp-att-1980"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Qtz_3rd.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1980" width="500" height="246" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Qtz_3rd.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Qtz_3rd-300x148.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Qtz_3rd-65x32.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Qtz_3rd-225x111.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Qtz_3rd-350x172.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.29</strong> Quartz is another silicate mineral with a three-dimensional framework of silica tetrahedra.

The presence of water makes it easier for ions to move to where there are needed, and can lead to the formation of larger crystals over shorter time periods, as with the gypsum crystals at the beginning of this chapter. Time is one of the most important factors because it takes time for atoms to line themselves up into an orderly structure. If time is limited, the mineral grains may remain very small.</p> <p>Most of the minerals that make up the rocks in the crust and mantle formed through the cooling of molten rock, known as <strong>magma</strong>. At the high temperatures that exist deep within Earth, some geological materials are liquid. As magma rises up through the crust, either by volcanic eruption or by more gradual processes, it cools and minerals crystallize. When cooling is rapid and many crystals form at once, only small mineral grains will form before the rock becomes solid. The resulting rock will be fine-grained (i.e., crystals less than 1 mm). When cooling is slow, or when few crystals are growing at a time, relatively large crystals will develop.</p> <p>Minerals can also form in several other ways:</p> <ul><li>Precipitation from a solution (e.g., from hot water flowing underground, or when evaporation concentrates ions in a lake or inland sea)</li> <li>Precipitation from a gas (e.g., from vents releasing volcanic gases)</li> <li>Metamorphism:  solid minerals react with each other under high pressures and temperatures, and new minerals are formed.</li> <li>Weathering: minerals unstable at Earth’s surface are chemically altered by surface processes.</li> <li>Organic formation: organisms build shells (primarily of calcite or aragonite), and teeth and bones (primarily of apatite).</li> </ul> </div></div>

A crystal of hematite on Mars will have the same properties as one on Earth, and the same as one on a planet orbiting another star. That’s good news for geology students who are planning interplanetary travel, because they can use the same properties to identify minerals anywhere. That doesn’t mean that it’s easy, however. Identification of minerals takes practice. Some of the mineral properties that are useful for identification are colour, streak, lustre, hardness, habit, cleavage or fracture, and density.</p> <h1>Colour</h1> <p>Some minerals have distinctive colours that useful as diagnostic criteria.&nbsp;The mineral sulphur (Figure 5.30 left) is always a characteristic bright yellow. For other minerals, colour might vary. Hematite is an example of a mineral for which colour is not necessarily diagnostic. In some forms hematite is a deep dull red (a fairly unique colour), but in others it is a metallic silvery black (5.30, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1995" style="width: 506px"><a href="#chapter-5-6-mineral-properties-2" rel="attachment wp-att-1995"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/colour_sulf_hem_3rd.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1995" width="506" height="321" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/colour_sulf_hem_3rd.png 792w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/colour_sulf_hem_3rd-300x190.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/colour_sulf_hem_3rd-768x487.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/colour_sulf_hem_3rd-65x41.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/colour_sulf_hem_3rd-225x143.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/colour_sulf_hem_3rd-350x222.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.30</strong> Colour is a useful diagnostic property for sulphur (left) and for some types of hematite (right) because the yellow and dark red colours are unique to those minerals.

The colour variations can be the result of varying proportions of trace elements within the mineral, or structural defects within the crystal lattice. In the case of quartz (Figure 5.31), milky quartz gets its white colour from millions of tiny fluid-filled cavities. Smoky quartz gets its grey colour from structural damage caused by natural radiation. Amethyst and citrine get their colours from trace amounts of iron, and rose quartz gets its pink hue from manganese.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2002" style="width: 547px"><a href="#chapter-5-6-mineral-properties-2" rel="attachment wp-att-2002"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/qtz_colour_3rd.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2002" width="547" height="342" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/qtz_colour_3rd.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/qtz_colour_3rd-300x188.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/qtz_colour_3rd-65x41.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/qtz_colour_3rd-225x141.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/qtz_colour_3rd-350x219.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.31</strong> The many colours of quartz.Quartz can be colourless, milky, a greyish smoky colour, purple, yellow, and pink. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

One reason that colour can be so variable is that the surface textureis variable. A way to get around this problem is to grind a small amount of the sample to a powder and observe the colour of the powder. This colour is the mineral’s <strong>streak</strong>. The mineral can be powdered by scraping the sample across a piece of unglazed porcelain called a <strong>streak plate</strong> (Figure 5.32). In Figure 5.32, two samples of hematite have been scraped across the streak plate. Even though one sample is metallic and the other is deep red, both have a similar reddish-brown streak.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2004" style="width: 478px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate-1024x400.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2004" width="478" height="187" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate-300x117.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate-768x300.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate-65x25.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate-225x88.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate-350x137.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Hematite_streak_plate.jpg 1182w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.32</strong> Hematite leaves a distinctive reddish-brown streak whether the sample is metallic or deep red. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2015) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Streak is an especially helpful property when minerals look similar.

The minerals are from upper left clockwise: hematite, magnetite, sphalerite, and galena. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2015) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <h1>Lustre</h1> <p>Lustre is the way light reflects off the surface of a mineral, and the degree to which it penetrates into the interior. The key distinction is between <strong>metallic</strong> and <strong>non-metallic lustre</strong>. Light does not pass through metals, and that is the main reason they look metallic (e.g., the hematite on left of Figure 5.32). Even a thin sheet of metal — such as aluminum foil — will be not permit light to pass through it. Many non-metallic minerals may look as if light will not pass through them, but if you look closely at a thin slice of the mineral you will see that the mineral is translucent or transparent.</p> <p>If a non-metallic mineral has a shiny, reflective surface, it is said to have a <strong>glassy</strong> lustre.&nbsp; The quartz crystals in Figure 5.31 are examples of minerals with glassy lustre. If the mineral surface is dull and non-reflective, it has an <strong>earthy</strong> lustre (like the hematite on the right of Figure 5.32). Other types of non-metallic lustres are silky, pearly, and resinous. Lustre is a good diagnostic property because most minerals will always appear either metallic or non-metallic, although as Figure 5.31 shows, there are exceptions.</p> <h1>Hardness</h1> <p>One of the most important diagnostic properties of a mineral is its hardness. In practical terms, hardness determines whether or not a mineral can be scratched by a particular material.</p> <p>In 1812 German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs came up with a list of 10 minerals representing a wide range of hardness, and numbered them 1 through 10 in order of increasing hardness (Figure 5.34, horizontal axis). While each mineral on the list is harder than the one before it, the measured hardness (vertical axis) is not linear. Notice that apatite is about three times harder than fluorite, and diamond is three times harder than corundum.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2010" style="width: 493px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2010" width="493" height="478" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness.png 824w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness-300x291.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness-768x745.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness-65x63.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness-225x218.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/Mohs-scale-of-hardness-350x339.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.34</strong> Minerals and reference materials in the Mohs scale of hardness. The measured hardness values are Vickers Hardness numbers. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Mohs-scale-of-hardness.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Some commonly available reference materials are also shown on this diagram, including a typical fingernail<span class="footnote">Note that artificial fingernails may be much harder than natural fingernails. Some materials used for artificial nails are harder than quartz.</span> (2.5), a piece of copper wire (3.5), a knife blade or piece of window glass (5.5), a hardened steel file (6.5), and a porcelain streak plate (7). These are tools that a geologist can use to measure the hardness of unknown minerals: if you have a mineral that you can’t scratch with your fingernail, but you can scratch with a copper wire, then its hardness is between 2.5 and 3.5. The minerals themselves can be used to test other minerals.</p> <h1>Crystal Habit</h1> <p>When minerals form within rocks, there is a possibility that they will form in distinctive crystal shapes if they are not crowded out by other pre-existing minerals. Every mineral has one or more distinctive <strong>crystal</strong> <strong>habits</strong> determined by their atomic structure, although it is not that common in ordinary rocks for the shapes to be obvious.</p> <p>Quartz, for instance, will form six-sided prisms with pointed ends (Figure 5.35 left), but this typically happens only when it crystallizes from a hot water solution within a cavity in an existing rock. Pyrite can form cubic crystals (Figure 5.35 centre), but can also form crystals with 12 faces, known as dodecahedra. The mineral garnet also forms many-sided crystals with an over-all rounded shape (Figure 5.35 right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2015" style="width: 556px"><a href="#chapter-5-6-mineral-properties-2" rel="attachment wp-att-2015"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xtl_habit_3rd-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2015" width="556" height="220" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xtl_habit_3rd-1.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xtl_habit_3rd-1-300x119.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xtl_habit_3rd-1-65x26.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xtl_habit_3rd-1-225x89.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xtl_habit_3rd-1-350x139.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.35</strong> Hexagonal prisms of quartz (left), intergrown cubic crystals of pyrite (centre), and 24-sided crystals of garnet (right). <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

These characteristics are the most important diagnostic features of many minerals, and often the most difficult to understand and identify. <strong>Cleavage</strong> is what we see when a mineral breaks along a plane or planes, while <strong>fracture</strong> is an irregular break. Some minerals tend to cleave along planes at various fixed orientations. Some, like quartz, do not cleave at all, only fracture. Minerals that have cleavage can also fracture along surfaces that are not parallel to their cleavage planes.</p> <p>The way minerals break is determined by the arrangement of atoms within them, and more specifically by the orientation of weaknesses within their crystal lattice. Graphite and mica break off in parallel sheets (Figure 5.36).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2021" style="width: 532px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2021"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd-1024x394.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2021" width="532" height="205" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd-1024x394.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd-300x115.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd-768x296.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd-65x25.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd-225x87.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd-350x135.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/1_cleavage_3rd.png 1458w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 5.36</strong> One direction of cleavage (basal cleavage).

Another issue is that sometimes cleavage is present, but it is poor, meaning the cleavage surface isn’t perfectly flat. Finally it can be difficult to know whether a flat surface on a crystal is a cleavage plane, a crystal face, or simply a surface that happens to be flat.&nbsp;Cleavage planes tend to repeat themselves at different depths throughout the mineral, so if you are unsure whether the surface you are looking at is a cleavage plane, try rotating the mineral in bright light. If cleavage is present, you will generally find that, for a given cleavage direction, all of the cleavage surfaces will glint in the light simultaneously. Crystal faces will also glint in light, but they do not repeat themselves at depth throughout the mineral. The best way to overcome all of these problems is to look at lots of examples.&nbsp; It’s worth it to be able to identify cleavage and fracture, because cleavage is a reliable diagnostic property for most minerals.</p> <h1>Density</h1> <p><strong>Density</strong> is a measure of the mass of a mineral per unit volume, and it is a useful diagnostic tool in some cases. Most common minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, calcite, amphibole, and mica, are of average density (2.6 to 3.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and it would be difficult to tell them apart on the basis of their density. On the other hand, many of the metallic minerals, such as pyrite, hematite, and magnetite, have densities over 5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. If you picked up a sample of one of these minerals, it would feel much heavier compared to a similarly sized sample of a mineral with average density. A limitation of using density as a diagnostic tool is that one cannot assess it in minerals that are a small part of a rock with other minerals in it.</p> <h1>Other properties</h1> <p>Several other properties are useful for identification of some minerals. Some of these are:</p> <ul><li>Calcite reacts with dilute acid and will give off bubbles of carbon dioxide.</li> <li>Magnetite is strongly magnetic, and some other minerals are weakly magnetic.</li> <li>Sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S) gives off a smell of sulphur when drawn across a streak plate.</li> <li>Halite tastes salty.</li> <li>Talc feels soapy to the touch.</li> <li>Plagioclase feldspar has striations (parallel razor-thin lines etched on the surface) and some varieties show a play of colours when light hits them at the right angle (see the labradorite in Figure 5.28).</li> </ul> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-5-summary-2" title="Chapter 5 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">35</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>5.1 Atoms</h3> <p>An atom is made up of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and electrons arranged in energy shells around the nucleus. The first shell holds two electrons, and outer shells hold more. Atoms strive to have eight electrons in their outermost shell (or two for H and He). Atoms gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve this. In so doing they become either positively charged cations (if they lose electrons) or negatively charged anions (if they gain them).</p> <h3>5.2 Bonding and Lattices</h3> <p>The main types of bonding in minerals are ionic bonding (electrons transferred) and covalent bonding (electrons shared). Some minerals have metallic bonding or weak Van der Waals forces. Minerals form in three-dimensional lattices. The configuration of the lattices and the type of bonding within help determine mineral properties.</p> <h3>5.3 Mineral Groups</h3> <p>Minerals are grouped according to the anion part of their formula. Some common types are: oxides, sulphides, sulphates, halides, carbonates, phosphates, silicates, and native minerals.</p> <h3>5.4 Silicate Minerals</h3> <p>Silicate minerals are the most common minerals in Earth’s crust and mantle. They all have silica tetrahedra (four oxygens surrounding a single silicon atom) arranged in different structures (chains, sheets, etc).</p> <h3>5.5 How Minerals Form</h3> <p>Most minerals in the crust form from the cooling and crystallization of magma. Some form from hot water solutions, during metamorphism or weathering, or through organic processes. More rarely, minerals precipitate directly from a gas, such as at a volcanic vent.</p> <h3>5.6 Mineral Properties</h3> <p>Some of the important properties for mineral identification include hardness, cleavage/fracture, density, lustre, colour, and streak colour.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <p>1. What is the electrical charge of a proton? A neutron? An electron? What are their relative masses?</p> <p>2. Explain how the need for an atom&#8217;s outer shell to be filled with electrons contributes to bonding.</p> <p>3. Why are helium and neon non-reactive?</p> <p>4. What is the difference in the role of electrons in an ionic bond compared to a covalent bond?</p> <p>5. How do cations differ from anions?</p> <p>6. What chemical feature is used in the classification of minerals into groups?</p> <p>7. Name the mineral group for the following minerals:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td>calcite</td> <td>biotite</td> <td>pyrite</td> </tr> <tr><td>gypsum</td> <td>galena</td> <td>orthoclase</td> </tr> <tr><td>hematite</td> <td>graphite</td> <td>magnetite</td> </tr> <tr><td>quartz</td> <td>fluorite</td> <td>olivine</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>8. What is the net charge on an unbonded silica tetrahedron?</p> <p>9. What allows magnesium to substitute freely for iron in olivine?</p> <p>10. How are the silica tetrahedra structured differently in pyroxene and amphibole?</p> <p>11. Why is biotite called a ferromagnesian mineral, while muscovite is not?</p> <p>12. What are the names and compositions of the two end-members of the plagioclase series?</p> <p>13. Why does quartz have no additional cations (other than Si<sup>+4</sup>)?</p> <p>14. Why is colour not necessarily a useful guide to mineral identification?</p> <p>15. You have an unknown mineral that can scratch glass but cannot scratch a porcelain streak plate. What is its approximate hardness?</p> </div></div>

Charges: proton: +1, neutron: 0, electron: -1, Masses: proton: 1, neutron: 1, electron: almost 0.</p> <p>2. The element’s atomic number will determine the extent to which its outer layers are populated with electrons. If the outer shell is not quite full, the atom may gain electrons to fill them and become an anion (negative charge). If the outer shell has only a few electrons, it may lose them and become a cation (positive charge). Cations and anions attract each other to form molecules with ionic bonding.</p> <p>3. Helium and neon (and the other noble gases) have complete outer shells and therefore no tendency to form ionic bonds.</p> <p>4. Electrons are transferred from one atom to another to form an ionic bond. Electrons are shared between atoms to form a covalent bond.</p> <p>5. An anion has a negative charge and a cation has a positive charge.</p> <p>6. Minerals are classified into groups based on their anion or anion group.</p> <p>7. Name the mineral group for the following minerals:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td>calcite</td> <td>CaCO<sub>3</sub>   carbonate</td> <td>biotite</td> <td>silicate</td> <td>pyrite</td> <td>FeS<sub>2</sub> sulphide</td> </tr> <tr><td>gypsum</td> <td>CaSO<sub>4</sub> sulphate</td> <td>galena</td> <td>PbS sulphide</td> <td>orthoclase</td> <td>KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> silicate</td> </tr> <tr><td>hematite</td> <td>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide</td> <td>graphite</td> <td>C native</td> <td>magnetite</td> <td>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> oxide</td> </tr> <tr><td>quartz</td> <td>SiO<sub>2</sub> silicate</td> <td>fluorite</td> <td>CaF<sub>2</sub> halide</td> <td>olivine</td> <td>MgSiO<sub>4</sub> silicate</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>8. An unbonded silica tetrahedron has one Si ion (+4 charge) and 4 oxygens (-2 charge each) so the overall charge is 4 – 8 = -4 for SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>-4</sup></p> <p><sup><br /> </sup>9. Magnesium can substitute freely for iron in olivine and several other minerals because they have similar charges (+2) and similar ionic radii.</p> <p>10. Pyroxene is made up of single chains of tetrahedra while amphibole is made up of double chains.</p> <p>11. The two end-members of the plagioclase series are Albite (NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) and Anorthite (CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>)</p> <p>12. In quartz each silica tetrahedron is bonded to four other tetrahedra, and because oxygens are shared at each bond the overall ratio is silicon (+4) to two oxygens (2 x -2 = -4), which is balanced.</p> <p>13. Some minerals have distinctive colours, but many have a wide range of colours due to differing impurities.</p> <p>14. Glass has a Mohs hardness of about 5.5 while porcelain is close to 6.5. The mineral is between these two, so it must be close to 6.</p> </div></div>

Geological materials include individual mineral crystals, inorganic non-mineral solids like glass, pieces broken from other rocks, and even fossils. The geological materials in rocks may be inorganic, but they can also include organic materials such as the partially decomposed plant matter preserved in coal. A rock can be composed of only one type of geological material or mineral, but many are composed of several types. Figure 6.2 shows a rock made of three different kinds of minerals.</p> <p>Rocks are grouped into three main categories based on how they form. <strong>Igneous rocks</strong> form when melted rock cools and solidifies. <strong>Sedimentary rocks</strong> form when fragments of other rocks are buried, compressed, and cemented together; or when minerals precipitate from solution, either directly or with the help of an organism. <strong>Metamorphic rocks</strong> form when heat and pressure alter a pre-existing rock. Although temperatures can be very high, metamorphism does not involve melting of the rock.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1892px"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pegmatite.png" alt="This close-up view of the igneous rock pegmatite shows black biotite crystals, colourless quartz crystals, and pink potassium feldspar crystals.

Existing rocks that are heated up and squeezed under those extreme conditions are transformed into <strong>metamorphic rocks</strong> (Figure 6.9). The transformation to a metamorphic rock can happen through physical changes, such as when the minerals making up an existing rock re-form into larger crystals of the same mineral. It can also happen through chemical changes, when minerals within the rock react to form new minerals.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1106" style="width: 653px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1106" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls-1024x478.jpg" alt="" width="653" height="305" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls-1024x478.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls-300x140.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls-768x359.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls-65x30.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls-225x105.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls-350x163.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/10/QuadraIsland_ls.jpg 1431w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 6.9</strong> Limestone, a sedimentary rock formed in marine waters, has been altered by metamorphism into this marble visible on Quadra Island, BC. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/limestone2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source </a></em></div></div> </div></div>

Geological materials include individual mineral crystals, inorganic non-mineral solids like glass, pieces broken from other rocks, and even fossils.</p> <h3>6.2 The Rock Cycle</h3> <p>There are three main types of rock. Igneous rocks form when melted rock cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rock forms from fragments of other rocks, or when crystals precipitate from solution. Metamorphic rocks form when existing rocks are altered by heat, pressure, and/or chemical reactions. The rock cycle summarizes the processes that contribute to transformation of rock from one type to another. The rock cycle is driven by Earth’s internal heat, and by processes happening at the surface that are driven by solar energy.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>What processes must take place to transform rocks into sediment?</li> <li>What processes normally take place in the transformation of sediments to sedimentary rock?</li> <li>What are the processes that lead to the formation of a metamorphic rock?</li> </ol> </div></div>

Melted rock originates within Earth as <strong>magma</strong>.  Magma compositions vary, but will have eight main elements in different proportions. The most abundant elements are oxygen and silicon, followed by aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, magnesium, and potassium. These eight elements are also the most abundant in Earth&#8217;s crust (Figure 7.2).  All magmas have varying proportions of lighter elements such as hydrogen, carbon, and sulphur. Lighter elements are converted into gases like water vapour, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, and sulphur dioxide as the magma cools.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2058" style="width: 470px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/earths-crust2.png"><img class="wp-image-2058" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/earths-crust2.png" alt="" width="470" height="325" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/earths-crust2.png 745w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/earths-crust2-300x207.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/earths-crust2-65x45.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/earths-crust2-225x156.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/earths-crust2-350x242.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.2</strong> Average composition of Earth&#8217;s crust by mass. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/earths-crust2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Magma composition depends on the composition of the rocks that melted to form the magma, and on the conditions under which the melting happened. Most igneous rock in Earth&#8217;s crust comes from magmas that formed through <strong>partial melting</strong> of existing rock, either in the upper mantle or the crust. During partial melting, only some of the minerals within a rock melt. This happens because different minerals have different melting temperatures. The melt is less dense than the surrounding rock, and will percolate upward without the source rock having melted completely. The result is magma with a different composition than the original rock. Partial melting produces melt that has more silica than the original rock, because minerals higher in silica have lower melting points.</p> <p>To see how partial melting works, consider the mix of materials in Figure 7.3a. It contains white blocks of candle wax, black plastic pipe, green beach glass, and pieces of aluminum wire. When the mixture is heated to 50 °C in a warm oven, the wax melts into a clear liquid (Figure 7.3b), but the other materials remain solid. This is partial melting.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2062" style="width: 406px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example.png"><img class="wp-image-2062" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example.png" alt="" width="406" height="407" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example-150x150.png 150w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example-300x300.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example-65x65.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example-225x226.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/partial_melting_example-350x351.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.3</strong> An experiment to illustrate partial melting.

This is still considered partial melting because solid materials remain. When the plastic and wax mixture is poured into a separate container and allowed to cool, the resulting solid has a very different composition from the original mixture (Figure 7.3d). The plastic and wax are analogous to more silica-rich minerals with relatively lower melting points than other minerals in the same rock.</p> <p>Of course, partial melting in the real world isn’t as simple as the example in Figure 7.3. Many rocks are much more complex than the four-component system used here. Some mineral components of rocks may have similar melting temperatures, and begin to melt at the same time. The melting temperature of a mineral may change in the presence of other minerals. Also, when rocks melt, the process can take millions of years, unlike the 90 minutes required to melt the pipe and wax in the experiment in Figure 7.3.</p> <h1>Why Rocks Melt</h1> <p>The magma that is produced by partial melting is less dense than the surrounding rock. Magma from partial melting of mantle rocks rises upward through the mantle, and may pool at the base of the crust, or rise through the crust. Moving magma carries heat with it, and some of that heat is transferred to surrounding rocks. If the melting temperature of a rock is less than the temperature of the magma, the rock will begin to melt, and the composition of the magma may change to reflect a mixture of sources. But adding heat is not the only way to trigger melting.</p> <h2>Decompression Melting</h2> <p>Earth&#8217;s mantle is almost entirely solid rock, in spite of temperatures that would cause rock at Earth&#8217;s surface to melt. Mantle rock remains solid at those temperatures because the rock is under high pressure. This means that melting can be triggered <em>without</em> adding heat if the rock is already hot enough, and the pressure is reduced (Figure 7.4, left, white dashed boxes). Melting triggered by a reduction in pressure is called <strong>decompression melting</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2066" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2066" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers-1024x504.png" alt="" width="1024" height="504" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers-1024x504.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers-300x148.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers-768x378.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers-65x32.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers-225x111.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers-350x172.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/melting_triggers.png 1200w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.4</strong> Melting triggers.

Pressure is also reduced where the crust thins, such as along rift zones.</p> <h2><strong>Flux-induced Melting</strong></h2> <p>When a substance such as water is added to hot rocks, the melting points of the minerals within those rocks decreases. If a rock is already close to its melting point, the effect of adding water can be enough to trigger partial melting. The added water is a <strong>flux</strong>, and this type of melting is called <strong>flux-induced melting</strong>. In Figure 7.4 (right), the rock (represented by the dashed box) is not hot enough to be right of the line where dry mantle rocks melt, but it is to the right of the line where wet mantle rocks melt.</p> <p>Flux-induced partial melting of rock happens in subduction zones. Minerals are transformed by chemical reactions under high pressures and temperatures, and a by-product of those transformations is water. Relatively little water is required to trigger partial melting. In laboratory studies of the conditions of partial melting in the Japanese volcanic arc, rocks with only 0.2% of their weight consisting of water melted by up to 25%.</p> <h1>Cooling Magma Becomes More Viscous</h1> <p><strong>Viscosity</strong> refers to the ease with which a substance flows. A substance with low viscosity is runnier than a substance with high viscosity. At temperatures over 1300°C, most magma is entirely liquid because there is too much energy for the atoms to bond together. As magma loses heat to the surrounding rocks and its temperature drops, things start to change. Silicon and oxygen combine to form silica tetrahedra.  With further cooling, the tetrahedra start to link together into chains, or <strong>polymerize</strong>. These silica chains make the magma more viscous. Magma viscosity has important implications for the characteristics of volcanic eruptions.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercise: Making Magma Viscous</h3> <p>This is a quick and easy experiment that you can do at home to help you understand the properties of magma. It will only take about 15 minutes, and all you need is half a cup of water and a few tablespoons of flour.</p> <p>If you’ve ever made gravy, white sauce, or roux, you’ll know how this works.</p> <p>Place 1/2 cup (125 mL) of water in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of white flour and stir while continuing to heat the mixture until boiling. The white flour represents silica. The mixture should thicken like gravy because the gluten in the flour becomes polymerized into chains during this process.</p> <p>Now add more “silica” to see how this changes the viscosity of your magma: take another 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of flour and mix it thoroughly with 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of water in a cup. Add that mixture to the rest of the water and flour in the saucepan. Stir while bringing it back up to nearly boiling temperature, and then allow it to cool. This mixture should slowly become much thicker (Figure 7.5) because there is more gluten, and more chains have formed.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2071" style="width: 264px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/making-magma-viscous2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2071" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/making-magma-viscous2.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="198" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/making-magma-viscous2.jpg 547w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/making-magma-viscous2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/making-magma-viscous2-65x49.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/making-magma-viscous2-225x169.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/making-magma-viscous2-350x262.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.5</strong> Thick mixture of flour and water. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/making-magma-viscous2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> </div> <h4>References</h4> <p class="hanging-indent">Kushiro, I.

He studied geology at Queen’s University and then at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1912 he joined the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., where he carried out ground-breaking experiments into how magma cools.</p> <p>Working mostly with mafic magmas (magmas rich in iron and magnesium), he determined the order of crystallization of minerals as the temperature drops. First, he melted the rock completely in a specially made kiln. Then he allowed it to cool slowly to a specific temperature before quenching (cooling it quickly) so that no new minerals could form. The rocks that formed were studied under the microscope and analyzed chemically. This was done over and over, each time allowing the magma to cool to a lower temperature before quenching.</p> <p>The result of these experiments was the reaction series which, even a century later, is still an important basis for our understanding of igneous rocks.</p> <h1>Discontinuous and Continuous Series</h1> <p>Bowen’s reaction series (Figure 7.6) has two pathways for minerals to form as magma cools: on the left is the <strong>discontinuous series</strong>. This refers to the fact that one mineral is transformed into a different mineral through chemical reactions. On the right is the <strong>continuous series</strong>, where plagioclase feldspar goes from being rich in calcium to being rich in sodium.</p> <h2>Continuous Series</h2> <p>At about the point where pyroxene begins to crystallize, plagioclase feldspar also begins to crystallize. At that temperature, the plagioclase is calcium-rich (toward the anorthite end-member). As the temperature drops, and providing that there is sodium left in the magma, the plagioclase that forms is a more sodium-rich variety (toward the albite end-member). The series is continuous because the mineral is always plagioclase feldspar, but the series involves a transition from calcium-rich to sodium-rich.</p> <p>When cooling happens relatively quickly, instead of getting crystals which are of uniform composition, individual plagioclase crystals can be <strong>zoned</strong> from calcium-rich in the centre to more sodium-rich around the outside (Figure 7.8). This occurs because calcium-rich early-forming plagioclase crystals become coated with progressively more sodium-rich plagioclase as the magma cools.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2088" style="width: 441px"><a href="#chapter-7-2-crystallization-of-magma-2" rel="attachment wp-att-2088"><img class="wp-image-2088" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/plagioklaz-NX-sm.jpeg" alt="" width="441" height="330" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/plagioklaz-NX-sm.jpeg 600w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/plagioklaz-NX-sm-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/plagioklaz-NX-sm-65x49.jpeg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/plagioklaz-NX-sm-225x168.jpeg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/plagioklaz-NX-sm-350x262.jpeg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.8</strong> Plagioclase crystal exhibiting compositional zones. <em>Source: Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza w Krakowie Otwartych Zasobów Edukacyjnych (n.d.)

The early-forming olivine crystals react with silica in the remaining liquid and are converted into pyroxene, something like this:</p> <div class="wp-nocaption wp-image-2082 size-medium aligncenter"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen.png"><img class="wp-image-2082 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen-300x63.png" alt="Mg2SiO4 + SiO2 goes to 2MgSiO3" width="300" height="63" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen-300x63.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen-768x161.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen-65x14.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen-225x47.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen-350x73.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/bowen.png 848w" /></a></div> <p>As long as there is silica remaining and the rate of cooling is slow, this process continues down the discontinuous branch: olivine reacts to form pyroxene, and the pyroxene reacts to form amphibole. Under the right conditions amphibole will form to biotite. Finally, if the magma is quite silica-rich to begin with, there will still be some left at around 750 °C to 800 °C, and from this last magma, potassium feldspar, quartz, and maybe muscovite mica will form.</p> <p>Notice that the sequence of minerals that form goes from isolated tetrahedra (olivine) toward increasingly complex arrangements of silica tetrahedra. Pyroxene consists of single chains, amphibole has double chains, mica has sheets of tetrahedra, and potassium feldspar and quartz at the bottom of the series have tetrahedra connected to each other in three dimensions.</p> <p>If the magma cools enough, the first minerals to form will be completely used up in later chemical reactions.&nbsp; This is why igneous rocks do not normally have both olivine (at the top of the series) and quartz (at the bottom). Exceptions can occur when rocks that crystallized early in the series come into contact with magmas representing compositions later in the series, such as with the dark green olivine-rich <strong>xenoliths</strong> included within the quartz- and feldspar-rich rock in Figure 7.9. The dark line around the xenoliths is amphibole, which formed as the olivine reacted with the melt. In some of the smaller xenoliths within this boulder, the olivine has been completely transformed into amphibole.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2092" style="width: 504px"><a href="#chapter-7-2-crystallization-of-magma-2" rel="attachment wp-att-2092"><img class="size-full wp-image-2092" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xenolith.png" alt="" width="504" height="245" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xenolith.png 504w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xenolith-300x146.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xenolith-65x32.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xenolith-225x109.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/xenolith-350x170.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.9</strong> Boulder with olivine-rich xenoliths surrounded by silica-rich rock.

In other words, it determines which minerals will form. Magma compositions are reported in terms of the fraction of mass of oxides (e.g., Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> rather than just Al; Figure 7.10). On average, <strong>mafic</strong><span class="footnote">"Mafic" combines the words <strong>MA</strong>gnesium and <strong>F</strong>err<strong>IC</strong> (containing iron).</span> magma (Figure 7.10, left) is approximately half SiO<sub>2</sub> by mass, and more than 25% iron, magnesium, and calcium oxides by mass. Average <strong>felsic</strong><span class="footnote">"Felsic" combines the words <strong>FEL</strong>dspar and <strong>SI</strong>li<strong>C</strong>a.</span> magmas (Figure 7.10, right) are closer to 75% SiO<sub>2</sub> by mass, and have approximately 5% iron, magnesium, and calcium oxides. Sodium and potassium oxides account for approximately 10% of felsic magmas by mass, but only 5% of mafic magmas. Magmas that fall between mafic and felsic magmas have an <strong>intermediate&nbsp;</strong>composition (Figure 7.10, centre).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2094" style="width: 546px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2.png"><img class="wp-image-2094" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2-1024x386.png" alt="" width="546" height="206" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2-1024x386.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2-300x113.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2-768x289.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2-65x25.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2-225x85.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2-350x132.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/mafic2.png 1154w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.10</strong> Chemical compositions of typical mafic, intermediate, and felsic magmas. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0 modified after Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/mafic2-300x168.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercise: Mafic, Intermediate, or Felsic?</h3> <p>The proportions of the main chemical components of felsic, intermediate, and mafic magmas are listed in the table below.

Notice that on the far right-hand side of the diagram under “Rock Types,” mafic, intermediate, and felsic magma compositions are listed.&nbsp; At the very top of the list is <strong>ultramafic</strong>. Ultramafic rocks have higher MgO than mafic rocks, and even less SiO<sub>2</sub>.</div> <div></div> <div>The vast majority of silicate rocks in Earth’s lithosphere are ultramafic rocks, because the mantle is composed of ultramafic rock. However, ultramafic magma is not encountered in modern volcanic environments, and ultramafic rocks are relatively rare at Earth’s surface. The reason is that although Earth was once hot enough to have ultramafic magma, it is no longer hot enough to melt ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic volcanic rocks—called <em>komatiites</em>—do exist, but with two notable exceptions, the youngest of these is 2 billion years old.<span class="footnote">The komatiites of the Song Da zone in northwestern Vietnam are 270 million years old, and those on Gorgona Island, Columbia are 89 million years old. Exactly how they formed is still a bit of a mystery. See Table 1 of arXiv:physics/0512118v2 [physics.geo-ph] for a compilation of komatiite ages with references.</span></div> <h2>Partial Melting Makes Magma That Is Richer in Silica</h2> <p>In partial melting, some components of a mixture melt before others do.&nbsp; In the case of mafic magma, it is produced when ultramafic rocks undergo partial melting. In general, silicate minerals with more silica will melt before those with less silica.&nbsp; This means the partial melt will have more silica than the rock as a whole.</p> <h2>Fractional Crystallization Also Makes Magma Richer In Silica</h2> <p>A number of processes that take place within a magma chamber can affect the types of rocks that form once magma cools and crystallizes. If the magma has a low viscosity— which is likely if the magma is mafic—the crystals that form early, such as olivine (Figure 7.11a), may slowly settle toward the bottom of the magma chamber (Figure 7.11b). This process is called <strong>fractional crystallization</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2097" style="width: 551px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2.png"><img class="wp-image-2097" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2-1024x641.png" alt="" width="551" height="345" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2-1024x641.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2-300x188.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2-768x481.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2-65x41.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2-225x141.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2-350x219.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chamber2.png 1226w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.11</strong> Formation of a zoned magma chamber. a- Olivine crystals form. b- Olivine crystals settle to the base of the magma chamber, leaving the upper part of the chamber richer in silica. c- Olivine crystals remelt, making magma at the base of the chamber more mafic. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/magma-chamber2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>The formation of olivine removes iron- and magnesium-rich components, leaving the overall composition of the magma near the top of the magma chamber more felsic.

Or, because the lower part of the magma chamber is likely to be hotter than the upper part, the crystals might remelt. If remelting happens, crystal settling will make the magma at the bottom of the chamber more mafic than it was to begin with (Figure 7.11c).</p> <h2>Magma Composition Also Changes When Other Rocks Are Melted And Mixed In</h2> <p>Magma chambers aren’t isolated from their surroundings.&nbsp; If the rock in which the magma chamber is located (called the <strong>country rock</strong>) is more felsic than the magma, the country rock may also melt, adding to the magma already in the magma chamber (Figure 7.12).&nbsp; Sometimes magma carries fragments of unmelted rock, called <strong>xenoliths</strong>, within it.&nbsp; Melting of xenoliths can also alter the composition of magma, as can re-melting of crystals that have settled out of the magma.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2105" style="width: 459px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chambers.png"><img class="wp-image-2105 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chambers.png" alt="" width="459" height="507" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chambers.png 459w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chambers-272x300.png 272w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chambers-65x72.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chambers-225x249.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/04/magma-chambers-350x387.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.12</strong> The composition of magma in a magma chamber is affected by fractional crystallization within the magma chamber, but it can also be affected by partial melting of the rock surrounding the magma chamber, melting of xenoliths within the magma, or re-melting of crystals that have settled to the bottom of the magma chamber. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/magma-chambers.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> </div></div>

An igneous rock at the boundary between the mafic and ultramafic fields (marked with a vertical dashed line) would have approximately 20% olivine, 50% pyroxene, and 30% Ca-rich plagioclase feldspar by volume.</p> <h1>Classification By Grain Size</h1> <p>The name an igneous rock gets also depends on whether it cools within Earth (an <strong>intrusive</strong> or <strong>plutonic</strong> igneous rock), or whether it cools on the Earth’s surface after erupting from a volcano (an <strong>extrusive</strong> or <strong>volcanic</strong> igneous rock). For example, a felsic <em>intrusive</em> rock is called <strong>granite</strong>, whereas a felsic <em>extrusive</em> rock is called <strong>rhyolite</strong>. Granite and rhyolite have the same mineral composition, but their grain size gives each a distinct appearance.</p> <p>The key difference between intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks—the size of crystals making them up—is related to how rapidly melted rock cools. The longer melted rock has to cool, the larger the crystals within it can become.&nbsp; Magma cools much slower within Earth than on Earth’s surface because magma within Earth is insulated by surrounding rock.&nbsp; Notice that in Figure 7.13, the intrusive rocks have crystals large enough that you can see individual crystals—either by identifying their boundaries, or seeing light reflecting from a crystal face.&nbsp; A rock with individual crystals that are visible to the unaided eye has a <strong>phaneritic</strong> or <strong>coarse-grained</strong> texture. The extrusive rocks in the second row have much smaller crystals.&nbsp; The crystals are so small that individual crystals cannot be distinguished, and the rock looks like a dull mass. A rock with crystals that are too small to see with the unaided eye has an <strong>aphanitic</strong> or <strong>fine-grained</strong> texture.&nbsp; Table 7.1 summarizes the key differences between intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks.</p> <table class="lines" style="width: 765px"><thead><tr><td style="width: 719px" colspan="3"><strong>Table 7.1 Comparison of Intrusive and Extrusive Igneous Rocks</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td style="width: 105px"></td> <td style="width: 301.8px"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Magma</span> cools within Earth</strong></td> <td style="width: 312.2px"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Lava</span> cools on Earth’s surface</strong></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td style="width: 105px"><em><strong>Terminology</strong></em></td> <td style="width: 301.8px">Intrusive/ plutonic</td> <td style="width: 312.2px">Extrusive/ volcanic</td> </tr> <tr><td style="width: 105px"><em><strong>Cooling rate</strong></em></td> <td style="width: 301.8px">Slow: surrounding rocks insulate the magma chamber.</td> <td style="width: 312.2px">Rapid: heat is exchanged with the atmosphere.</td> </tr> <tr><td style="width: 105px"><em><strong>Texture</strong></em></td> <td style="width: 301.8px"><strong>Phaneritic</strong> (coarse-grained): individual crystals are large enough to see without magnification.</td> <td style="width: 312.2px"><strong>Aphanitic </strong>(fine-grained): crystals are too small to see without magnification.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>What this means is that two igneous rocks comprised of exactly the same minerals, and in the exactly the same proportions, can have different names.&nbsp; A rock of intermediate composition is <strong>diorite</strong> if it is course-grained, and <strong>andesite</strong> if it is fine-grained.&nbsp; A mafic rock is <strong>gabbro</strong> if it is course-grained, and <strong>basalt</strong> if fine-grained. The course-grained version of an ultramafic rock is <strong>peridotite</strong>, and the fine-grained version is <strong>komatiite</strong>. It makes sense to use different names because rocks of different grain sizes form in different ways and in different geological settings.</p> <h2>Does This Mean an Igneous Rock Can Only Have One Grain Size?</h2> <p>No. Something interesting happens when there is a change in the rate at which melted rock is cooling.&nbsp; If magma is cooling in a magma chamber, some minerals will begin to crystallize before others do.&nbsp; If cooling is slow enough, those crystals can become quite large.</p> <p>Now imagine the magma is suddenly heaved out of the magma chamber and erupted from a volcano.&nbsp; The larger crystals will flow out with the lava. The lava will then cool rapidly, and the larger crystals will be surrounded by much smaller ones.&nbsp; An igneous rock with crystals of distinctly different size (Figure 7.14) is said to have a <strong>porphyritic</strong> texture, or might be referred to as a <strong>porphyry</strong>.&nbsp; The larger crystals are called <strong>phenocrysts</strong>, and the smaller ones are referred to as the <strong>groundmass</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2118" style="width: 531px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/porphyry_3rd.png"><img class="wp-image-2118" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/porphyry_3rd.png" alt="" width="531" height="338" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/porphyry_3rd.png 750w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/porphyry_3rd-300x191.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/porphyry_3rd-65x41.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/porphyry_3rd-225x143.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/porphyry_3rd-350x223.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.14</strong> Porphyritic rhyolite with quartz and potassium feldspar phenocrysts within a dark groundmass.

If an igneous rock is porphyritic but otherwise aphanitic (e.g., Figure 7.14), the minerals present as phenocrysts give clues to the identity of the rock. However, there are cases where mineral composition cannot be determined by looking at visible crystals. These include volcanic rocks without phenocrysts, and glassy igneous rocks.</p> <h2>Volcanic Rocks Without Phenocrysts</h2> <p>In the absence of visible crystals or phenocrysts, volcanic rocks are be classified on the basis of colour and other textural features. As you may have noticed in Figure 7.13, the colour of volcanic rocks goes from light to dark as the composition goes from felsic to mafic. Rhyolite is often a tan or pinkish colour, andesite is often grey, and basalt ranges from brown to dark green to black (Figure 7.19).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2129" style="width: 551px"><a href="#chapter-7-3-classification-of-igneous-rocks-2"><img class="wp-image-2129" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/volcanic_rock_ID_3rd.png" alt="" width="551" height="425" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/volcanic_rock_ID_3rd.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/volcanic_rock_ID_3rd-300x231.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/volcanic_rock_ID_3rd-65x50.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/volcanic_rock_ID_3rd-225x173.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/volcanic_rock_ID_3rd-350x270.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.19</strong> In volcanic igneous rocks, individual crystals are not visible.

When magma is underground, pressure keeps gases dissolved, but once magma has erupted, the pressure is much lower. Gases dissolved in the lava are released, and bubbles can develop. When lava freezes around the bubbles, <strong>vesicles</strong> are formed (circular inset in 7.19). If the vesicles are later filled by other minerals, the filled vesicles are called <strong>amygdules</strong> (box inset in Figure 7.19).</p> <h2>Glassy Volcanic Rocks</h2> <p>Crystal size is a function of cooling rate. The faster magma or lava cools, the smaller the crystals it contains. It is possible for lava to cool so rapidly that no crystals can form. The result is called <strong>volcanic glass</strong>. Volcanic glass can be smooth like <strong>obsidian</strong> or vesicular like <strong>scoria </strong>(mafic) and <strong>pumice</strong> (felsic; Figure 7.20). Pumice can float on water because of its low-density felsic composition and enclosed vesicles.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2132" style="width: 715px"><a href="#chapter-7-3-classification-of-igneous-rocks-2"><img class="wp-image-2132" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/glassy_rx_3rd.png" alt="" width="715" height="229" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/glassy_rx_3rd.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/glassy_rx_3rd-300x96.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/glassy_rx_3rd-768x246.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/glassy_rx_3rd-65x21.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/glassy_rx_3rd-225x72.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/glassy_rx_3rd-350x112.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.20</strong> Glassy volcanic rocks.

If an irregularly shaped body has an area greater than 100 km<sup>2</sup>, then it’s a batholith, otherwise it&#8217;s a stock.

A body with an area of less than 100 km<sup>2 </sup> exposed at the surface might in fact be much larger at depth. It might be classified as a stock initially, until someone is able to map out its true extent.</p> <p>Batholiths are typically formed when a number of stocks coalesce beneath the surface to create one large body. One of the largest batholiths in the world is the Coast Range Plutonic Complex<span class="footnote">Also referred to as the Coast Range Batholith</span>, which extends all the way from the Vancouver region to southeastern Alaska (Figure 7.23).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_3163" style="width: 328px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th.png"><img class="wp-image-3163" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th-438x1024.png" alt="" width="328" height="767" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th-438x1024.png 438w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th-128x300.png 128w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th-768x1794.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th-65x152.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th-225x525.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th-350x817.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/batholith_4th.png 1312w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.23</strong> The Coast Range Plutonic Complex (also called the Coast Range Batholith) is the largest in the world.

Modified after Bally (1989).</em></div></div> <h2>Tabular Intrusions</h2> <p>Tabular (sheet-like) plutons are classified according to whether or not they are <strong>concordant</strong> with (parallel to) existing layering (e.g., sedimentary bedding or metamorphic foliation<span class="footnote">Sedimentary bedding refers to the layers in which sedimentary rocks form. Metamorphic foliation refers to the way minerals or other elements in a rock are aligned as a result of being deformed by heat and pressure. Bedding and foliation will be discussed in more detail in later chapters.</span>) in the country rock. A <strong>sill</strong> is concordant with existing layering, and a <strong>dike</strong><span class="footnote">Also spelled <em>dyke</em>.</span> is <strong>discordant</strong>. If the country rock has no bedding or foliation, then any tabular body within it is a dike. Note that the sill-versus-dike designation is not determined simply by the orientation of the feature. A dike could be horizontal and a sill could be vertical- it all depends on the orientation of features in the surrounding rocks.</p> <p>A <strong>laccolith</strong> is a sill-like body that has expanded upward by deforming the overlying rock. If a sill forms, but magma pools and sags downward, it creates a <strong>lopolith</strong>.</p> <h2>Pipes</h2> <p>A <strong>pipe</strong>, as the name suggests, is a cylindrical body with a circular, elliptical, or even irregular cross-section, that serves as a conduit (or pipeline) for the movement of magma from one location to another. Pipes may feed volcanoes, but pipes can also connect plutons.</p> <h1>Chilled Margins</h1> <p>As discussed already, plutons can interact with the rocks into which they are intruded. Partial melting of the country rock may occur, or stoping may form xenoliths. The heat from magma can even cause causing mineralogical and textural changes in country rock. However, country rock can also affect the magma.</p> <p>The most obvious effect that country rock can have on magma is a <strong>chilled margin</strong> along the edges of the pluton (Figure 7.24). The country rock is much cooler than the magma, so magma that comes into contact with the country rock cools faster than magma toward the interior of the pluton. Rapid cooling leads to smaller crystals, so the texture along the edges of the pluton is different from that of the interior of the pluton, and the colour may be darker.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2147" style="width: 598px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/mafic-dyke2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2147" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/mafic-dyke2.png" alt="" width="598" height="418" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/mafic-dyke2.png 598w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/mafic-dyke2-300x210.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/mafic-dyke2-65x45.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/mafic-dyke2-225x157.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/mafic-dyke2-350x245.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 7.24</strong> A mafic dike with chilled margins within basalt at Nanoose, B.C.

The chemistry of magma depends on the source rock that is melting, as well as the degree of partial melting that occurs. Magma forms by decompression melting, flux-induced melting, and heat transfer. Magmas range in composition from ultramafic to felsic. Mafic rocks are rich in iron, magnesium, and calcium, and contain approximately 50% silica. Felsic rocks are richer in silica (~70%) and have lower levels of iron, magnesium, and calcium, and higher levels of sodium and potassium than mafic rocks.</p> <h3>7.2 Crystallization of Magma</h3> <p>As a body of magma starts to cool, the first process to take place is the polymerization of silica tetrahedra into chains. This increases the magma’s viscosity (makes it thicker) and because felsic magmas have more silica than mafic magmas, they tend to be more viscous. Bowen&#8217;s reaction series allows us to predict the order of crystallization of magma as it cools. Magma can be modified by fractional crystallization (separation of early-forming crystals), by mixing in material from the surrounding rocks by partial melting, and by mixing with magmas of differing chemistry.</p> <h3>7.3 Classification of Igneous Rocks</h3> <p>Igneous rocks are classified based on their mineral composition and texture. Felsic igneous rocks have less than 20% dark minerals (ferromagnesian silicates including amphibole and/or biotite) with varying amounts of quartz, both potassium and plagioclase feldspars, and sometimes muscovite. Mafic igneous rocks have more than 50% dark minerals (primarily pyroxene) plus plagioclase feldspar. Most intrusive igneous rocks are phaneritic (individual crystals are visible unmagnified). If there were two stages of cooling (slow then fast), the texture may be porphyritic (large crystals in a matrix of smaller crystals).</p> <h3>7.4 Intrusive Igneous Bodies</h3> <p>Magma intrudes into country rock by pushing it aside or melting through it. Intrusive igneous bodies tend to be irregular (stocks and batholiths), tabular (dikes and sills), or pipe-like. Batholiths have areas of 100 km<sup>2</sup> or greater, while stocks are smaller. Sills are parallel to existing layering in the country rock, while dikes cut across layering. A pluton that intruded into cold rock is likely to have a chilled margin.<strong><br /> </strong></p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <p>1. What is the significance of the term <em>reaction </em>in <em>Bowen&#8217;s reaction series</em>?</p> <p>2. Why is it common for plagioclase crystals to be zoned from relatively calcium-rich in the middle to more sodium-rich toward the edge?</p> <p>3. What must happen within a magma chamber for fractional crystallization to take place?</p> <p>4. Explain the difference between aphanitic and phaneritic textures.</p> <p>5. Name the following rocks:<br /> (a) An extrusive rock with 40% Ca-rich plagioclase and 60% pyroxene<br /> (b) An intrusive rock with 65% plagioclase, 25% amphibole, and 10% pyroxene<br /> (c) An intrusive rock with 25% quartz, 20% potassium feldspar, 50% plagioclase feldspar, and minor amounts of biotite</p> <p>6. What is the difference between a concordant tabular intrusion and a discordant tabular intrusion?</p> <p>7. Why do dikes commonly have fine-grained margins?</p> <p>8. What is the difference between a batholith and a stock?</p> <p>9. Describe two ways in which batholiths intrude into existing rock.</p> <p>10. Why is compositional layering a common feature of mafic plutons but not of felsic plutons?</p> </div></div>

As the temperature decreases minerals that formed early (e.g., olivine) may react with the remaining magma to form new minerals (e.g., pyroxene).</p> <p>2. Calcium-rich plagioclase forms early on in the cooling process of a magma, but as the temperature drops, a more sodium-rich variety forms around the existing crystals.</p> <p>3. Some minerals must begin to form while melt is still present. Early-forming minerals, which are typically quite dense (e.g., olivine), will sink to the bottom of the magma chamber if the magma is not too viscous, thus becoming separated from the rest of the magma. The composition of the remaining magma will be more felsic than before.</p> <p>4. Phaneritic texture means that individual crystals can be distinguished by the naked eye. Aphanitic texture means that individual crystals cannot be distinguished without a microscope. The dividing line is somewhere between 0.1 and 1 mm, depending on the minerals.</p> <p>5. a) basalt; b) diorite; c) granite</p> <p>6. A concordant body (a sill) is parallel to any pre-existing layering (e.g., bedding or foliation) in the country rock is. A discordant body (a dike) cuts across any pre-existing layering, or has intruded in country rock without layering (e.g., in granite).</p> <p>7. When the hot magma intrudes into cold country rock, the margins cool quickly and small crystals form, whereas magma that is not in contact with the cool country rock will cool more slowly, and larger crystals will form. The chilled margin is the band of small crystals along the edge of the dike.</p> <p>8. A batholith has an area of 100 km<sup>2</sup> or greater, whereas a stock is smaller.</p> <p>9. Batholiths (or stocks) intrude into existing rock by (a) melting through the country rock, or (b) causing the country rock to break and fall into the magma (stoping), or (c) pushing the country rock aside.</p> <p>10. Compositional layering forms when early-crystallizing minerals sink toward the bottom of a magma chamber. This can only happen in non-viscous magma. Mafic magma is typically much less viscous than felsic magma.</p> <h1></h1> </div></div>

Rocks that form deep within Earth experience relatively constant temperature, high pressure, have no contact with the atmosphere, and little or no interaction with moving water. Once overlying layers are eroded away and a rock is exposed at the surface, conditions change dramatically. Temperatures vary widely, and pressure is much lower. Reactive gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide are plentiful, and in many climates, water is abundant.</p> <p>Weathering can be characterized as&nbsp;<strong>mechanical&nbsp;</strong>(or&nbsp;<strong>physical</strong>), and&nbsp;<strong>chemical</strong>. In mechanical weathering, physical processes break rock into smaller pieces. In chemical weathering, chemical reactions change minerals into forms that are less affected by chemical reactions that occur at Earth’s surface. Mechanical and chemical weathering reinforce each other, because mechanical weathering provides new fresh surfaces for attack by chemical processes, and chemical weathering weakens the rock so that it is more susceptible to mechanical weathering. Together, these processes create the particles and ions that can eventually become sedimentary rock.&nbsp; They also create soil, which is necessary for our existence on Earth.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-8-1-mechanical-weathering-2" title="8.1 Mechanical Weathering"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">47</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">8.1 Mechanical Weathering</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Intrusive igneous rocks form at depths of 100s of metres to 10s of kilometres. Most metamorphic rocks are formed at depths of kilometres to 10s of kilometres. Sediments are turned into sedimentary rocks only when they are buried by other sediments to depths in excess of several 100s of metres. Weathering cannot happen until these rocks are revealed at Earth’s surface by uplift and the erosion of overlying materials. Once the rock is exposed at the surface as an <strong>outcrop</strong>, weathering begins.</p> <p>The agents of mechanical weathering can be broadly classified into two groups: those that cause the outer layers of a rock to expand, and those that act like wedges to force the rock apart.</p> <h1>Mechanical Weathering By Expansion</h1> <p>Some processes at Earth’s surface can cause a thin outer layer of a rock to expand. Deeper than the thin outer layer, the rock does not expand. The difference is accommodated by a crack developing between the outer and inner layers, breaking the outer layer off in slabs (Figures 8.2 and 8.3). When layers break off a rock in slabs or sheets, it is referred to as <strong>exfoliation</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2187" style="width: 609px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2187"><img class="wp-image-2187" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small-1024x577.jpg" alt="" width="609" height="343" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small-300x169.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small-768x433.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small-65x37.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small-225x127.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small-350x197.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock_small.jpg 1170w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.2</strong> Close-up view of exfoliation of a granite dome in the Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, Texas, USA. <em>Source: Wing-Chi Poon (2005) CC BY-SA 2.5 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GeologicalExfoliationOfGraniteRock.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2188" style="width: 613px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Coquihalla_exfoliation_SE.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2188"><img class="wp-image-2188" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Coquihalla_exfoliation_SE.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="441" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Coquihalla_exfoliation_SE.jpg 658w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Coquihalla_exfoliation_SE-300x216.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Coquihalla_exfoliation_SE-65x47.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Coquihalla_exfoliation_SE-225x162.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Coquihalla_exfoliation_SE-350x252.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.3</strong> View of exfoliation at a distance (centre of image) in granite exposed on the west side of the Coquihalla Highway north of Hope, B.C. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image005.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Granite tends to exfoliate parallel to the exposed surface because it does not have planes of weakness to determine how it breaks. In contrast, sedimentary rocks tend to exfoliate along the contacts between different sedimentary layers, and metamorphic rocks tend to exfoliate parallel to aligned minerals.</p> <h2>Reasons Rocks Expand</h2> <p>A rock within the Earth has pressure exerted upon it by other rocks sitting above it. This is called <strong>confining pressure. </strong>When the overlying mass is removed by weathering, the confining pressure decreases, allowing the rock to expand. The cracking that results is sometimes called <strong>pressure-release cracking</strong>.</p> <p>Heating a rock can also cause it to expand. If the rock is heated rapidly, as during a wildfire, cracks can form. If it goes through large daily temperature swings (e.g., in the desert where it is very hot during the day but cold at night), cracking can also eventually result as the rock is weakened.</p> <h1>Mechanical Weathering by Wedging</h1> <p>In wedging, a pre-existing crack in a rock is made larger by forcing it open.</p> <h2>Frost Wedging</h2> <p><strong>Frost wedging</strong> (or <strong>ice wedging</strong>) happens when water seeps into cracks, then expands upon freezing. The expansion enlarges the cracks (Figure 8.4). The effectiveness of frost wedging depends on how often freezing and thawing occur.&nbsp; Frost wedging won’t be as important in warm areas where freezing is infrequent, in very cold areas where thawing is infrequent, or in very dry areas, where there is little water to seep into cracks.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2189" style="width: 640px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2189"><img class="wp-image-2189" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging.png" alt="" width="640" height="303" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging-300x142.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging-768x364.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging-65x31.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging-225x107.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Ice-wedging-350x166.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.4</strong> A rock broken by ice wedging sits in a stream in Mount Revelstoke National Park, Canada.

In many parts of Canada, the temperature swings between freezing at night and thawing in the day tens to hundreds of times a year.&nbsp;Even in warm coastal areas of southern British Columbia, freezing and thawing transitions are common at higher elevations. A common feature in areas of effective frost wedging is a talus slope — a fan-shaped deposit of fragments removed by frost wedging from the steep rocky slopes above (Figure 8.5).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2190" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2190"><img class="wp-image-2190" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE-1024x698.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="409" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE-1024x698.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE-300x205.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE-768x524.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE-65x44.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE-225x153.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE-350x239.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/talus_slope_SE.jpg 1094w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.5</strong> An area with very effective frost wedging near Keremeos, BC.

Salt crystals grow within cracks and pores in the rock, and the growth of these crystals can push grains apart, causing the rock to weaken and break. There are many examples of this on the rocky shorelines of Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, where sandstone outcrops are common and salty seawater is readily available (Figure 8.6). The honeycomb structure of rounded holes, called <strong>tafoni</strong>, is related to the original roughness of the surface. Low spots collect salt water, causing the effect to be accentuated around existing holes.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2191" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/tafoni_SE.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2191"><img class="wp-image-2191" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/tafoni_SE.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="268" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/tafoni_SE.jpg 717w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/tafoni_SE-300x134.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/tafoni_SE-65x29.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/tafoni_SE-225x100.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/tafoni_SE-350x156.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.6</strong> Tafoni (Honeycomb weathering) in sandstone on Gabriola Island, British Columbia.

The kinds of changes that take place are specific to the mineral and the environmental conditions. Some minerals, like quartz, are virtually unaffected by chemical weathering. Others, like feldspar, are easily altered.</p> <h1>Types of Chemical Weathering Reactions</h1> <h2>Dissolution</h2> <p><strong>Dissolution</strong> reactions produce ions, but no minerals, and are reversible if the solvent is removed. A household example would be dissolving a teaspoon of table salt (the mineral halite) in a glass of water. The halite will separate into Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> ions. If the water in the glass is allowed to evaporate, there will not be enough water molecules to hold the Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup> ions apart, and the ions will come together again to form halite. Gypsum and anhydrite are other minerals that will dissolve in water alone.</p> <p>Other minerals, such as calcite, will dissolve in acidic water. Acidic water is common in nature, because carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere reacts with water vapour in the atmosphere, and with water on land and in the oceans to produce carbonic acid (Figure 8.9).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2204" style="width: 561px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2204"><img class="wp-image-2204" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018.png" alt="" width="561" height="391" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018-300x209.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018-768x535.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018-65x45.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018-225x157.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Dissolution_rxn_2018-350x244.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.9</strong> Calcite weathering by dissolution.

The dam itself is constructed on limestone supported by beds of gypsum and anhydrite. Gypsum and anhydrite are soluble in water, and the gypsum and anhydrite beneath the dam are rapidly dissolving away. This was the case prior to construction of the dam. However, once the dam was filled, the increased water pressure began to force water through the formations much faster, accelerating dissolution. Ongoing measures to fill gaps with grout are required, or else there is a grave risk of catastrophic failure, placing nearly 1.5 million people at risk.</p> <h2>Hydrolysis</h2> <p>The term <strong>hydrolysis</strong> combines the prefix <em>hydro</em>, referring to water, with <em>lysis</em>, which is derived from a Greek word meaning to loosen or dissolve. Thus, you can think of hydrolysis as a chemical reaction where water loosens the chemical bonds within a mineral. This might sound the same as dissolution but the difference is that hydrolysis produces a different mineral in addition to ions. An example of hydrolysis is when water reacts with potassium feldspar to produce <strong>clay minerals</strong> and ions. The results can be seen by comparing weathered and unweathered surfaces of the same sample of granite (Figure 8.11). On the recently broken unweathered surface (Figure 8.11, left) feldspar is visible as bright white crystals. On a weathered surface (right) the feldspar has been altered to the chalky-looking clay mineral kaolinite.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2211" style="width: 578px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/hydrolysis_granite.png"><img class="wp-image-2211" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/hydrolysis_granite.png" alt="Potassium feldspar (formula KAlSi3O8) is broken down by water to produce kaolinite (a clay mineral, formula Al2Si2O5(OH)4), quartz (formula SiO2), and potassium and hydroxyl ions." width="578" height="340" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/hydrolysis_granite.png 576w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/hydrolysis_granite-300x177.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/hydrolysis_granite-65x38.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/hydrolysis_granite-225x132.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/hydrolysis_granite-350x206.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.11</strong> A piece of granite with unweathered (left) and weathered (right) surfaces.

For example, pyroxene can be converted to the clay minerals chlorite or smectite. Olivine can be converted to the clay mineral serpentine.</p> <h2>Hydration</h2> <p>Hydration reactions involve water being added to the chemical structure of a mineral. An example of a hydration reaction is when anhydrite (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) is transformed into gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O). A consequence of hydration is that the resulting mineral has a greater volume than the original mineral. In the case of the Mosul Dam, hydration of anhydrite has important consequences. The increase in volume applied force to an overlying limestone layer, breaking it into pieces. While unbroken limestone is a strong enough material upon which to build a foundation, broken limestone is too weak to provide a safe foundation.</p> <h2>Oxidation</h2> <p><strong>Oxidation </strong>happens when free oxygen (i.e., oxygen not bound up in molecules with other elements) is involved in chemical reactions. Oxidation reactions provide valuable insight into Earth’s early surface conditions because there is a clear transition in the rock record from rocks containing no minerals that are products of oxidation reactions, to rocks containing abundant minerals produced by oxidation. This reflects a transition from an oxygen-free atmosphere to an oxygenated one.</p> <p>In iron-rich minerals such as olivine, the oxidation reaction begins with taking iron out of the mineral and putting it into solution as an ion. Olivine reacts with carbonic acid, leaving dissolved iron, bicarbonate, and silicic acid:</p> <p style="text-align: center">Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>→ 2Fe<sup><sub>2</sub>+</sup> +  4HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup> +  H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></p> <p>Iron and oxygen dissolved in water react in the presence of bicarbonate to produce hematite and carbonic acid:</p> <p style="text-align: center">2Fe<sup><sub>2</sub>+</sup>  + ½ O<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + 4HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>  → Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3  </sub>+ 4H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></p> <p>When the olivine in basalt is oxidized, the basalt takes on a reddish colour that is distinct from the dark grey or black of unweathered basalt (Figure 8.12).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2212" style="width: 563px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2212" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="422" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes.jpg 800w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes-300x225.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes-768x576.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes-65x49.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes-225x169.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/pillow-lava-Banco-de-Imagenes-350x263.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.12</strong> Basalt pillows in Andalusia, Spain, with reddish weathered surfaces.

Some of the worst examples of ARD are at metal mine sites, especially where pyrite-bearing rock and waste material have been mined from deep underground, and then piled up and left exposed to water and oxygen. In these cases the problem is referred to as <strong>acid mine drainage</strong>. One example is the Mt. Washington Mine near Courtenay on Vancouver Island (Figure 8.12), but there are many similar sites across Canada and around the world.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2217" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine.png"><img class="wp-image-2217" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine-1024x425.png" alt="" width="600" height="249" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine-1024x425.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine-300x125.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine-768x319.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine-65x27.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine-225x93.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine-350x145.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine.png 1354w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.14</strong> Acid mine drainage.

The same types of weathering do not happen in all environments. There are a variety of factors that determine what kinds of weathering will occur, and how fast the processes will proceed.</p> <h1>Climate</h1> <p>Water and temperature are key factors controlling both weathering rates and the types of weathering that occur:</p> <ul><li>Water is required for chemical weathering reactions to occur.</li> <li>Water must be present for ice wedging to happen.</li> <li>Higher temperatures speed up chemical reactions.</li> <li>Climate will determine whether water is present mostly in liquid form, solid form (ice), or both.</li> <li>Climate will determine what plant life is available to force rocks apart with their roots, and to contribute organic acids to soils to aid in chemical weathering.</li> </ul> <p>This means, for example, that chemical weathering will be faster in a tropical rainforest than in the Arctic, a cold desert. It means physical weathering will be the predominant form of weathering in the Arctic.</p> <h1>Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide</h1> <p>The presence and abundance of oxygen and carbon dioxide affect chemical weathering rates. Surface environments on Earth almost all have some free oxygen available, permitting oxidation reactions to take place. Exceptions are in settings such as deep lakes or swamps where oxygen cannot easily mix into the water, and where biological processes consume the oxygen rapidly.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide, which acidifies water and contributes to chemical weathering, is more concentrated in some settings than others. For example, because of the activities of organisms, soils can have very high concentrations of carbon dioxide, whereas carbon dioxide concentrations will be lower on surfaces free of soils and exposed to the atmosphere.</p> <h1>Minerals</h1> <p>The minerals making up a rock will determine what kinds of chemical weathering reactions are possible, and how rapidly chemical weathering reactions occur. Under the same conditions, dissolution of the calcite making up limestone will occur more rapidly than hydrolysis reactions happening to feldspar in granite. Quartz is very resilient to chemical weathering, and will remain long after calcite and feldspar have been weathered away. A rock with grains cemented by calcite will weather faster than a rock with grains cemented by quartz.</p> <p>In general, differences in the rates of chemical weathering among minerals can be broken down as follows:</p> <ul><li>Minerals that weather by dissolution (e.g., halite, gypsum, calcite) are the easiest to weather.</li> <li>Silicate minerals with lower silica to oxygen ratios (e.g., silicates made of isolated silica tetrahedra or single chains) are easier to weather than silicate minerals with higher ratios (e.g., those made of silica tetrahedra arranged sheets or frameworks).</li> <li>Minerals that are by-products of chemical weathering are some of the most resistant to further chemical weathering, although they may be more prone to physical weathering (e.g., clay minerals).</li> </ul> <h1>Weathering Makes Weathering Go Faster</h1> <p>Weathering accelerates weathering. Physical weathering forms cracks and breaks rocks apart into smaller pieces. The smaller the pieces, the greater the surface area exposed to chemical weathering. When the newly exposed surfaces are exposed to chemical weathering, it weakens the rock even further, making it more susceptible to physical weathering processes.</p> <h1>Differential Weathering</h1> <p>When rocks in an outcrop weather at different rates, the result is called <strong>differential weathering</strong>. Differential weathering causes some beds in an outcrop to be recessed relative to the others, because beds that are slow to weather will take longer to recede than weaker beds (Figure 8.15).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2224" style="width: 427px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/differential_weathering.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2224" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/differential_weathering-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="569" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/differential_weathering-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/differential_weathering-225x300.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/differential_weathering-65x87.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/differential_weathering-350x467.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/differential_weathering.jpg 1536w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.15</strong> Differential weathering in an outcrop along the Blaeberry River near Golden BC.

If and when deposits like these are turned into sedimentary rocks, the mineralogy and textures of these rocks will vary significantly.

Small clasts might be single mineral grains, but larger ones can have several different mineral grains, or even several different pieces of rock within them.&nbsp; The composition can tell us about what rock the sediments came from, and about the geological setting from which the sediment was derived.</p> <p>Not all minerals have the same hardness and resistance to weathering, so as weathering and erosion proceed, some minerals become more abundant than others within sediments. Quartz is one example of a mineral that is more abundant. It is highly resistant to weathering by weak acids or reaction with oxygen. This makes it unique among the minerals that are common in igneous rocks. Quartz is also very hard, so it is resistant to mechanical weathering.</p> <p>In contrast, feldspar and iron- and magnesium-bearing minerals are not as resistant to weathering. As weathering proceeds, they are likely to be broken into small pieces and converted into clay minerals and dissolved ions. Ultimately this means that quartz, clay minerals, iron oxides, aluminum oxides, and dissolved ions are the most common products of weathering.</p> <h1>Grain Size</h1> <p>Whether a grain is large or small tells us about its journey from its source to where it was deposited.&nbsp; Mechanical weathering can break off large pieces from rock.&nbsp; Large pieces carried along by streams will bump into each other, causing smaller pieces to break off.&nbsp; Over time the grains get smaller and smaller still. If we find grains that are very small, we can conclude that they travelled over a long distance.</p> <p>Geologists have a specific set of definitions to describe the size of grains (Figure 8.17).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2234" style="width: 447px"><a href="#chapter-8-4-weathering-and-erosion-produce-sediments"><img class="wp-image-2234" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Grain-size-chart.png" alt="" width="447" height="256" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Grain-size-chart.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Grain-size-chart-300x172.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Grain-size-chart-768x440.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Grain-size-chart-65x37.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Grain-size-chart-225x129.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Grain-size-chart-350x201.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.17 </strong>Classification of grain sizes. Silt and clay are considered fine-grained particles, sand is medium-grained, and particles larger than sand are considered coarse-grained.. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2016) CC BY 4.0 Click the image for a text version.</em></div></div> <p>The scale has some of the grain sizes listed in microns (µm). There are 1000&nbsp;µm in 1 mm. The particles classified as sand are what you would intuitively think of as being sand-sized, so an easy way to remember the scale is that anything smaller than sand is fine-grained, and anything larger is coarse-grained. Fine sand grains are still easily discernible with the naked eye. Silt grains are barely discernible in rocks, and silty rocks feel gritty when rubbed. Clay grains are invisible to the naked eye, and rocks comprised of clay feel smooth when rubbed.</p> <p>One other thing to notice about this scale is that the finest-grained particle is referred to as clay. While a clay-sized particle could be composed of clay minerals (and often they are), it doesn’t have to be. Any particle of that size would be referred to as clay.</p> <h2>Grain Size and Transportation</h2> <p>The grain size of sediments is not just for purposes of description. It’s also a valuable clue to the processes that have acted on those sediments, because the size of the clast determines how much energy is required to move it.</p> <p>Whether or not a medium such as water or air has the ability to move a clast of a particular size and keep it moving depends on the velocity of the flow.&nbsp; For the most part, the faster the medium flows, the larger the clasts that can be moved. Figure 8.18 shows a stream bed that now contains only a trickle of water—barely enough to move particles of sand or cool puppy feet. But the velocity of water in the stream changes from season to season, as does the volume of water.&nbsp; All of the clasts in the stream bed were transported there by water at some point.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_250" style="width: 500px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871.jpg"><img class="wp-image-250" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871-1024x871.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="425" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871-300x255.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871-768x653.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871-65x55.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871-225x191.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IMG_4497-1024x871-350x298.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.18</strong> Ruby looks upstream in a channel near Golden BC. For much of the year the only water in the stream is the trickle in which Ruby stands, but in the spring the water can flow rapidly enough to carry boulders. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2009) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <p>Very fine-grained particles are the exception to rule that the larger the clasts, the faster the water that is required to transport them. Clay and silt grains stick together, requiring higher water velocities to pick them up and move them than some larger particles. Water that flows fast enough to pick up sand would not be fast enough to pick up clay.</p> <h1>Sorting</h1> <p>Weathering can break off large fragments of rock, and erosion and transport can break these fragments down to smaller and smaller sizes. The extent to which the grains in sediment differ in size is described by <strong>sorting</strong> (Figure 8.19, top).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_251" style="width: 438px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IODP-sorting-and-rounding.png"><img class="wp-image-251" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IODP-sorting-and-rounding.png" alt="" width="438" height="268" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IODP-sorting-and-rounding.png 764w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IODP-sorting-and-rounding-300x184.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IODP-sorting-and-rounding-65x40.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IODP-sorting-and-rounding-225x138.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/IODP-sorting-and-rounding-350x214.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.19</strong> Top: Sorting of grains, ranging from well sorted where the grains are similar in size, to poorly sorted, where the grains vary greatly in size.

Because grains become progressively smaller as they are transported, sorting improves the further the sediments are from their source.</p> <h1>Rounding</h1> <p><strong>Rounding</strong> refers to whether clasts have sharp edges and corners or not (Figure 8.19, bottom). If the grains are rough, with lots of edges and corners, then they are referred to as angular. Grains with smooth surfaces are rounded. Grains in between can be sub-angular or sub-rounded. The farther sediments are transported, the rounder they become.</p> <h1>Sphericity</h1> <p><strong>Sphericity</strong> describes whether a grain is elongate or not.&nbsp; Grains that are longer than they are wide (like an ellipse) have low sphericity, whereas grains that have the same diameter no matter where you measure it (like a sphere) have high sphericity. In the bottom row of boxes in Figure 8.19 the grains at the top of each box exhibit high sphericity, and the grains at the bottom exhibit low sphericity.&nbsp; Notice that a grain can be angular but still have high sphericity.&nbsp; It can be rounded, but still have low sphericity.

The factors that affect the nature of soil and the rate of its formation include:</p> <ul><li>Climate, especially average temperature and precipitation amounts, and the consequent types of vegetation</li> <li>The parent rock or sediment that was weathered to make the soil</li> <li>The slope of the surface where soil is accumulating</li> <li>How long soil has been forming at a location</li> </ul> <h2>Climate</h2> <p>Both the mechanical breakup of rocks and the chemical weathering of minerals contribute to soil formation.&nbsp; The downward percolation of water brings dissolved ions and also facilitates chemical reactions. Soil forms most readily under temperate to tropical conditions, and moderate precipitation.&nbsp; Temperature matters because chemical weathering reactions and those facilitated by organisms proceed fastest under warm conditions, and plant growth is enhanced in warm climates. Where the climate is cooler, the rates of chemical weathering reactions decrease, and when water is frozen, may cease entirely.</p> <p>Although water is needed for chemical weathering to take place, too much water can lead to soils that lack nutrients. In rain forests, for example, high rainfall contributes so much water that important nutrients are leached away, and acidic soils are left behind. In humid and poorly drained regions, swampy conditions may prevail, producing soil that is dominated by organic matter, but low in inorganic nutrients.</p> <p>Too little water (e.g., in deserts and semi-deserts) limits the rate of downward chemical transport, and it also means that salts and carbonate ions dissolved in upward-moving groundwater can precipitate and build up in sediments, hindering organic activity. These soils also lack organic matter (Figure 8.22).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2247" style="width: 466px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/loess_SE.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2247" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/loess_SE.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="492" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/loess_SE.jpg 733w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/loess_SE-284x300.jpg 284w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/loess_SE-65x69.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/loess_SE-225x238.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/loess_SE-350x370.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.22</strong> Soil consisting of wind-blown silt (loess) and little organic matter in an arid part of north-eastern Washington state. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image047.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <h2>Parent Material</h2> <p>Parent material for soils can be any type of bedrock, and any type of unconsolidated sediment, such as glacial deposits and stream deposits. Soils are described as <strong>residual soils</strong> if they develop on bedrock, and <strong>transported soils</strong> if they develop on transported material such as glacial sediments. This doesn’t mean that the soils themselves have been transported, but that the soil developed on unconsolidated material rather than on bedrock.</p> <p>Sandy soils develop from quartz-rich parent material, such as granite, sandstone, or loose sand. Quartz-poor material, such as shale or basalt, generates soils with little sand.</p> <p>Parent materials provide important nutrients to residual soils. For example, a minor constituent of granitic rocks is the calcium-phosphate mineral apatite, which is a source of the important soil nutrient phosphorus. Basaltic parent material tends to generate very fertile soils because, in addition to phosphorus, it provides significant amounts of iron, magnesium, and calcium.&nbsp; The iron, magnesium, and calcium come from minerals such as olivine ((Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) and plagioclase feldspar (CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) in the basalt.</p> <p>Some unconsolidated materials, such as river-flood deposits, make for especially good soils because they tend to be rich in clay minerals. Clay minerals have large surface areas with negative charges that are attractive to positively charged elements like calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium — important nutrients for plant growth.</p> <h2>Slope</h2> <p>Soil can only develop where surface materials remain in place and are not frequently washed away or lost to mass wasting (landslides). Soils cannot develop where the rate of soil formation is lower than the rate of erosion, so steep slopes tend to have little or no soil.</p> <h2>Time</h2> <p>Even under ideal conditions, soil takes thousands of years to develop. Virtually all of southern Canada was covered with glaciers up until 14,000 years ago, and most of the central and northern parts of BC, the prairies, Ontario, and Quebec were still glaciated at 12,000 years ago. Glaciers remained in the central and northern parts of Canada until around 10,000 years ago, so conditions were still not ideal for soil development even in the southern regions. This means that soils in Canada, particularly in central and northern Canada, are relatively young and not well developed.</p> <p>The same applies to soils that are forming on newly created surfaces, such as recent deltas or sand bars, in areas of mass wasting, or where an area has been resurfaced by volcanic deposits.</p> <p>Because soil takes so long to form, human activities that damage soils have long-term consequences for ecosystems, and for the utility of the soil for food production.</p> <h1>Soil Horizons</h1> <p>When soils form, the downward movement of clay, water, and dissolved ions can lead to the development of chemically and texturally distinct layers known as <strong>soil horizons</strong>. In temperate climates, common soil horizons that develop are the following (Figure 8.23):</p> <ul><li>O horizon— A layer of organic matter</li> <li>A horizon— Partially decayed organic matter mixed with mineral material</li> <li>E horizon— The eluviated (leached) layer from which some of the clay and iron have been removed to create a pale layer that may be sandier than the other layers</li> <li>B horizon— Where clay, iron, and other elements from the overlying soil accumulate</li> <li>C horizon— Contains broken fragments of rock. Weathering of the underlying bedrock or sediments is not yet complete.</li> </ul> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2249" style="width: 432px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/soil-horizons.png"><img class="wp-image-2249 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/soil-horizons.png" alt="" width="432" height="527" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/soil-horizons.png 432w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/soil-horizons-246x300.png 246w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/soil-horizons-65x79.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/soil-horizons-225x274.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/soil-horizons-350x427.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.23</strong> Typical horizons in a temperate soil, from Wales.

It forms from the downward (or in some cases upward) movement of calcium ions, and the precipitation of calcite within the soil. When well developed, caliche cements the surrounding material together to form a layer that has the consistency of concrete.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1>How Soil Is Lost</h1> <p>Like all geological materials, soil is subject to erosion.&nbsp; Under natural conditions on gentle slopes, the rate of soil formation either balances or exceeds the rate of erosion. However, human practices related to forestry and agriculture have significantly upset this balance.</p> <p>Soils are held in place by vegetation. When vegetation is removed, either through cutting trees or routinely harvesting crops and tilling the soil, this protection is lost. When soil is not protected, wind and water can easily erode it away.</p> <p>Water erosion is accentuated on sloped surfaces because fast-flowing water has greater eroding power than still water. Raindrops can disaggregate exposed soil particles, putting clay into suspension in the water. <strong>Sheetwash</strong>—unchannelled flow across a surface—carries suspended material away, and channels erode right through the soil layer, removing both fine and coarse material (Figure 8.24).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2295" style="width: 506px"><a href="#chapter-8-5-weathering-and-soil-formation" rel="attachment wp-att-2295"><img class="wp-image-2295" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/photo-2-2-1_l.jpg" alt="" width="506" height="336" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/photo-2-2-1_l.jpg 1000w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/photo-2-2-1_l-300x199.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/photo-2-2-1_l-768x509.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/photo-2-2-1_l-65x43.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/photo-2-2-1_l-225x149.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/photo-2-2-1_l-350x232.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.24</strong> Soil erosion by rain and unchanneled runoff in a field in Alberta. <em>Source:Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development.

In Canada’s predominantly cool and humid climate—characteristic of most places other than the far north— <strong>podzolization</strong> is the norm. This involves downward transportation of hydrogen, iron, and aluminum from the upper part of the soil profile, and accumulation of clay, iron, and aluminum in the B-horizon. Most of the <strong>podzols, luvisols</strong>, and <strong>brunisols</strong> of Canada form through various types of podzolization.</p> <p>In the grasslands of the dry southern parts of the prairie provinces and in some of the drier parts of southern BC, dark brown organic-rich <strong>chernozem</strong> soils are dominant. In some cases, weak calcification takes place when calcium is leached from the upper layers and accumulates in the B-horizon. Development of caliche layers is rare in Canada.</p> <p><strong>Organic soils</strong> form in areas with poor drainage and a rich supply of organic matter, such as in swamps. These soils have very little mineral matter.</p> <p>In the permafrost regions of the north, where glacial retreat was most recent, the time available for soil formation has been short and the rate of soil formation slow. The soils are called <strong>cryosols</strong> (the <em>cryo</em> prefix is used to indicate extreme cold). In permafrost areas, the freeze-thaw process churns the soil, resulting in limited soil horizon development.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title" style="text-align: center">Exercise: Soils of Canada</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>Examine Figure 8.26 showing the distribution of soils in Canada, or use the interactive map by clicking on the figure.

Over the short term, biological processes are important. In particular, living organisms — mostly plants — consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make their tissues.  After they die, the carbon is released back into the atmosphere over years to decades as the plant matter decays.</p> <p>Over the longer term, geological processes drive the carbon cycle. Geological carbon-cycle processes operate very slowly, but they affect much more of Earth&#8217;s carbon than the biological component. Carbon can move from the biological cycle to the geological cycle if it is buried in sedimentary rocks. The biological carbon could be fragments of plant material or organic molecules that are preserved as coal or in organic-rich shale. It could also be calcium carbonate body parts of marine organisms that are preserved in limestone.</p> <p>The geological component of the carbon cycle is shown in Figure 8.27. The various steps in the process (not necessarily in this order) are as follows:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>a:</strong></td> <td>Organic matter from plants is stored in peat, coal, and permafrost for thousands to millions of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>b:</strong></td> <td>Weathering of silicate minerals converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, which is stored in the oceans for thousands to tens of thousands of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>c:</strong></td> <td>Dissolved carbon is converted by marine organisms to calcite, which is stored in carbonate rocks for tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>d:</strong></td> <td>Organic carbon compounds are stored in sediments for tens to hundreds of millions of years; some end up in petroleum deposits.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>e:</strong></td> <td>Carbon-bearing sediments are transferred to the mantle, where the carbon may be stored for tens of millions to billions of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>f:</strong></td> <td>During volcanic eruptions, carbon dioxide is released back to the atmosphere, where it is stored for years to decades.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2318" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2318" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057-1024x323.png" alt="" width="1024" height="323" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057-1024x323.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057-300x95.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057-768x242.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057-65x20.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057-225x71.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057-350x110.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/image057.png 1209w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 8.27</strong> The geological component of the carbon cycle includes: (a) organic carbon in peat, coal and permafrost, (b) weathering of silicate minerals converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, (c) marine organisms convert dissolved carbon to calcium carbonate, (d) carbon compounds are stored in sediments, (e) carbon-bearing sediments are transferred to longer-term storage in the mantle, and (f) carbon dioxide is released back to atmosphere during volcanic eruptions. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image057.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At some times in Earth’s history, the geological carbon cycle has been balanced, with carbon being released to the atmosphere by some processes at approximately the same rate as other processes store it. Under these conditions, the climate can remain relatively stable.</p> <p>At other times, the balance is upset. Prolonged periods of greater than average volcanism can cause an imbalance. The eruption of the Siberian Traps at around 250 Ma warmed the climate significantly over a few million years, leading to a mass extinction.</p> <p>Mountain-building events may also cause an imbalance. The formation of the Himalaya range between about 40 Ma and 10 Ma ago exposed rocks to weathering over a large region. The over-all rate of weathering on Earth increased because the mountains were so high, and the range was so extensive. The weathering of these rocks — most importantly the hydrolysis of feldspar — consumed atmospheric carbon dioxide and transferred carbon to the oceans and to ocean-floor carbonate minerals. Decreasing carbon dioxide levels contributed to climate cooling that culminated in the Pleistocene glaciations.</p> <p>Today, burning fossil fuels is causing an imbalance in the carbon cycle. Burning coal, oil, and gas releases in a geological instant carbon that was stored by the biological carbon cycle over hundreds of millions of years. Scientists who study Earth&#8217;s past climate tell us that today carbon dioxide is being added to the atmosphere faster than during some of the most extreme climate change events in Earth history. Eventually, higher carbon dioxide levels will accelerate chemical weathering, and that will help to remove some of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, weathering is part of the geological carbon cycle, and operates over long timescales. If humans stopped burning all fossil fuels today, it could still take thousands of years for balance to be restored.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-8-summary-2" title="Chapter 8 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">54</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 8 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>8.1 Mechanical Weathering</h3> <p>Rocks weather when they are exposed to surface conditions. In most cases, conditions at Earth&#8217;s surface are very different from the conditions under which the rocks formed. Mechanical weathering processes include exfoliation, freeze-thaw, salt crystallization, and the wedging effects of plant growth.</p> <h3>8.2 Chemical Weathering</h3> <p>Chemical weathering takes place when minerals within rocks are not chemically stable in their existing environment. Chemical weathering processes include hydrolysis of silicate minerals to form clay minerals, oxidation of iron in silicate and other minerals to form iron oxide minerals, and dissolution of calcite.</p> <h3>8.3 Controls on Weathering Processes and Rates</h3> <p>Chemical weathering is faster when temperatures are warmer and moisture is present. Physical weathering is more important in regions with frequent freeze-thaw cycles. Weathering rates can depend on the abundance oxygen and carbon, and will vary with the mineral composition of a rock. Weathering accelerates weathering by exposing more surface area to chemical reactions.</p> <h3>8.4 Weathering and Erosion Produce Sediments</h3> <p>Quartz grains are one of main products of weathering and erosion because quartz is resistant to chemical and mechanical weathering. Clay minerals, iron oxide and iron hydroxide minerals, aluminum hydroxide minerals, and ions in solution are common products of chemical weathering. Particles produced by weathering can be described in terms of their composition, grain size, sorting, rounding, and sphericity.</p> <h3>8.5 Weathering and Soil Formation</h3> <p>Soil is a mixture of fine mineral fragments (including quartz and clay minerals), organic matter, and empty spaces that may be partially filled with water. Soil formation is controlled by climate (especially temperature and humidity), the nature of the parent material, the slope (because soil can’t accumulate on steep slopes), and the amount of time available. Typical soils have layers called horizons, which form because of differences in the conditions with depth.</p> <h3>8.6 Soils of Canada</h3> <p>Canada has a range of soil types related to our unique conditions. The main types of soil form in forested and grassland regions, but there are extensive wetlands in Canada that produce organic soils, and large areas where soil development is poor because of cold conditions.</p> <h3>8.7 Weathering and Climate Change</h3> <p>The geological component of the carbon cycle affects Earth&#8217;s climate over the long term by changing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Carbon is added to the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions. It is extracted from the atmosphere when silicate minerals are weathered, and when it is transformed into organic matter by plants. Organic matter can be stored in soil, permafrost, and rocks. Burning of fossil fuels involves moving carbon from geological reservoirs to the atmosphere on timescales much faster than the geological carbon cycle operates.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>What must happen to a body of rock before exfoliation can occur?</li> <li>Saskatchewan&#8217;s climate is consistently cold in the winter and consistently warm in the summer. What times of year would frost wedging to be an important weathering mechanism?</li> <li>What are the products of the hydrolysis of the feldspar albite (NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>)?</li> <li>Oxidation weathering of  pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) can lead to acid rock drainage (ARD). What are the environmental impacts of ARD?</li> <li>Imagine that you and a friend encounter an old graveyard on a walk through the forest. You see a granite tombstone with the date 1705 carved into it. The tombstone next to it is too badly weathered to read the date. Your friend looks at the badly weathered stone and declares, &#8220;Look how weathered this stone is! It must be from <em>way</em> before 1705.&#8221; Do you agree?</li> <li>Many sand deposits are dominated by quartz, with very little feldspar. What weathering and erosion conditions are required to get feldspar-rich sand?</li> <li>What ultimately happens to most of the clay that forms during the hydrolysis of silicate minerals?</li> <li>Why are the slope and the parent materials important factors in soil formation?</li> <li>Which soil constituents move downward to produce the B-horizon of a soil?</li> <li>What are the main processes that lead to the erosion of soils in Canada?</li> <li>Where in Canada would you expect to find a chernozemic soil? What characteristics of this region produce this type of soil?</li> <li>Where are brunisolic soils found in Saskatchewan?</li> <li>Why does weathering of silicate minerals, especially feldspar, lead to consumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide? What eventually happens to the carbon that is involved in that process?</li> </ol> </div></div>

It has to be uplifted from where it formed deep in the crust, and the material on top has to be eroded.</li> <li>Frost wedging is most effective when temperatures swing between freezing and thawing from day to day.

The weight of the overlying sediments pushes the clasts together, closing up some of the pore spaces (the gaps between grains) and forcing them together. Pore spaces often contain water (although they can also contain air or even hydrocarbons), so the water is squeezed out.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_268" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-268" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409-1024x409.png" alt="" width="1024" height="409" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409-300x120.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409-768x307.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409-65x26.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409-225x90.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/lithification-1024x409-350x140.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 9.3</strong> Lithification turns sediments into solid rock.

Conglomerates form in high-energy environments, such as fast-flowing rivers, where the particles can become rounded as they bump into each other while being carried along.  Breccias typically form where the particles are not transported a significant distance, such as in alluvial fans and talus slopes.</p> <h2>Medium-Grained Clastic Rocks</h2> <p><strong>Sandstone</strong> (Figure 9.5, middle row) is a very common sedimentary rock, and there are many different kinds of sandstone. It is worth knowing something about the different types because they are organized according to characteristics that are useful for the detective work of figuring out what conditions led to the formation of a particular sandstone. Broadly, sandstones can be divided into two groups: arenite and wacke (rhymes with tacky).</p> <p><strong>Arenite</strong> is “clean” sandstone consisting mostly of sand-sized grains and cement, with less than 15% of fine-grained silt and clay in the <strong>matrix</strong> (the material between the sand-sized grains). Arenites are subdivided according to what the sand-sized grains are made of (Figure 9.6). If 90% or more of the grains are quartz, then the sandstone is called a <strong>quartz arenite</strong> (also called a <strong>quartz sandstone</strong>). If more than 10% of the grains are feldspar and more of the grains are feldspar than fragments of other rocks (lithic<span class="footnote">“Lithic” means “rock.” Lithic clasts are rock fragments (multimineralic fragments), as opposed to single-mineral fragments.</span> fragments) then the sandstone is called an <strong>arkosic arenite</strong>, or just <strong>arkose</strong>. If the rock has more than 10% rock fragments, and more rock fragments than feldspar, it is <strong>lithic arenite</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_271" style="width: 573px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/arenite-sandstones/"><img class="size-full wp-image-271" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/arenite-sandstones.png" alt="" width="573" height="465" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/arenite-sandstones.png 573w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/arenite-sandstones-300x243.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/arenite-sandstones-65x53.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/arenite-sandstones-225x183.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/arenite-sandstones-350x284.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 9.6</strong> A compositional triangle for arenite sandstones, with the three most common components of sand-sized grains: quartz, feldspar, and rock fragments.

By examining clastic sedimentary rocks it is possible to translate the classification you have just learned into an interpretation of the environment in which the rocks were deposited.</p> <h1>Sediment Maturity</h1> <p>Maturity in sediments refers to the extent to which sediment characteristics reflect prolonged weathering and transport. Prolonged weathering and transport cause clasts to become smaller, rounder, and more well-sorted. It removes minerals that are more susceptible to weathering, such as feldspar, leaving a sediment consisting predominantly of quartz or clay. On the spectrum of sediment maturity, quartz sandstone or shale would be mature sedimentary rocks, and wacke or conglomerate would be an immature rocks.</p> </div> </div> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-9-2-chemical-and-biochemical-sedimentary-rocks-2" title="9.2 Chemical and Biochemical Sedimentary Rocks"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">57</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">9.2 Chemical and Biochemical Sedimentary Rocks</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>Clastic sedimentary rocks are dominated by components that have been transported as solid clasts (clay, silt, sand, etc.). In contrast, chemical and biochemical sedimentary rocks are dominated by components that have been transported as ions in solution (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, HCO<sub>3<sup>–</sup></sub>, etc.). There is some overlap between the two because almost all clastic sedimentary rocks contain cement formed from dissolved ions, and many chemical sedimentary rocks include some clasts. The difference between chemical and biochemical sedimentary rocks is that in biochemical sedimentary rocks, organisms play a role in turning the ions into sediment. This means the presence and nature of biochemical sedimentary rocks are linked to the life requirements of the organisms that comprise them. In chemical sedimentary rocks, the process is inorganic, often resulting from a body of water evaporating and concentrating the ions.  It is possible for one type of sedimentary rock to form from both chemical (inorganic) and biochemical (organically mediated) processes.</p> <p>Chemical and biochemical sedimentary rocks are classified based on the minerals they contain, and are frequently dominated by a single mineral. It is true that some clastic sedimentary rocks, such as quartz arenite, can also be dominated by a single mineral, but the reasons for this are different. A clastic sedimentary rock can contain whatever minerals were present in the parent rock.  The minerals the clastic rock ends up containing will depend on how much “processing” the sediments undergo by physical and chemical weathering, and transport, before the sediment was cemented. On the other hand, chemical sedimentary rocks are limited largely to those minerals that are highly soluble in water.  Because mineral content is a defining characteristic of chemical and biochemical sedimentary rocks, we will use it to organize our discussion of these rocks.</p> <h1>Carbonate Rocks</h1> <p>Carbonate rocks are those in which the dominant mineral contains the carbonate anion (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>).  The main carbonate minerals are calcite and aragonite. Both minerals have the formula CaCO<sub>3</sub> but they have different crystal structures.  A less common carbonate mineral that is still important for forming carbonate rocks is dolomite, which has the formula CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. It is similar to calcite and aragonite, except that some of the calcium is replaced with magnesium. Dolomite is more common as a replacement mineral, which has replaced calcite in carbonate rocks.</p> <h2>Limestone</h2> <p><strong>Limestone</strong> is comprised of calcite and aragonite. It can occur as a chemical sedimentary rock, forming inorganically due to precipitation, but most limestone is biochemical in origin.  In fact, limestone is by far the most common biochemical sedimentary rock.</p> <p>Almost all limestone forms in marine (i.e., oceans or salty seas) environments, and most of that forms on the shallow continental shelves, especially in tropical regions with coral reefs. Today continental shelves are relatively narrow zones along the margins of continents, but for large parts of geologic history sea-level was much higher, and large parts of the interiors of continents were flooded.</p> <p>Reefs are highly productive ecosystems populated by a wide range of organisms, many of which use calcium and bicarbonate ions from seawater to make carbonate minerals (especially calcite) for their shells and other structures. These include corals as well as green and red algae, urchins, sponges, molluscs, and crustaceans. Some of micro-organisms use CaCO<sub>3</sub> to build tiny <strong>tests</strong> (shells) which accumulate on the ocean floor when these organisms die. Erosion can break all of these carbonate materials apart, scattering fragments throughout surrounding region (Figure 9.9).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_276" style="width: 477px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/corals.png"><img class="wp-image-276" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/corals.png" alt="" width="477" height="359" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/corals.png 641w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/corals-300x226.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/corals-65x49.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/corals-225x169.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/corals-350x263.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 9.9 </strong>Various corals and green algae on a reef at Ambergris, Belize.

Dolostone is quite common (there’s a whole Italian mountain range named after it), which is surprising because marine organisms do not precipitate dolomite. Dolomite forms through <strong>dolomitization</strong>, a process thought to involve chemical reactions between magnesium-rich water percolating through rocks, and sediments containing calcite.</p> <p>Calcite and dolomite can be distinguished from one another by applying a drop of weak acid to the rock; calcite will react with weak acid, whereas dolomite will not. Also, when dolomite weathers, it tends to turn buff (tan) in colour, whereas calcite tends toward grey and white.</p> <h1>Chert</h1> <p>Chert is made of silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>). It has the same chemical formula as quartz, but is <strong>cryptocrystalline</strong>, meaning that the quartz crystals comprising chert are so small that it is difficult to see them even under a microscope.  Chert can be a chemical sedimentary rock, often forming as beds within limestone (Figure 9.14), or as irregular lenses or blobs (nodules). It can also be biochemical. Some tiny marine organisms (e.g., diatoms and radiolaria) make their tests from silica. When they die their tiny shells (or tests) settle slowly to the bottom of the lake or ocean, where they accumulate and are transformed into chert.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_281" style="width: 722px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Chert.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-281" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Chert.png" alt="" width="722" height="524" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Chert.png 722w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Chert-300x218.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Chert-65x47.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Chert-225x163.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Chert-350x254.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 9.14</strong> Chert (brown layers) interbedded with limestone, Triassic Quatsino Fm, Quadra Island, BC.

The result was that iron oxide minerals precipitated and sank to the ocean floor. The prevalence of BIFs in rocks dating from 2400 to 1800 Ma reflects a time when free oxygen was being added to the atmosphere, but removed just as quickly by chemical reactions. After 1800 Ma, little dissolved iron was left in the oceans so no more BIFs formed.</div> <h1>Evaporites</h1> <div><p>In arid regions, lakes and inland seas typically have no stream outlet, and the water that flows into them is removed only by evaporation.

Most coal forms in swampy land adjacent to rivers and within deltas, and where climates are humid and tropical to temperate. The vigorous growth of vegetation leads to an abundance of organic matter that accumulates within stagnant, acidic water. This limits decay and oxidation of the organic material. If this situation—where the dead organic matter is submerged in oxygen-poor water—is maintained for centuries to millennia, a thick layer of material can accumulate.

The amount of heating will determine how far this process progresses.</p> <p>The further the process does progress, the more the coal will go from having obvious pieces of plant material within it, to being a black, shiny mass.  Low-grade <strong>lignite</strong> coal forms at depths between 100 m to 1,500 m and temperatures up to ~50°C (Figure 9.18c). This is still a relatively early stage in the coal formation process, so the lignite commonly displays plant fossils that have not yet been destroyed in the process of coalification (Figure 9.19 upper right).</p> <p>At between 1,000 m to 5,000 m depth and temperatures up to 150°C m, <strong>bituminous</strong> <strong>coal</strong> forms (Figure 9.18d, 9.19 lower right). At depths beyond 5,000 m and temperatures over 150°C, <strong>anthracite</strong> coal forms (Figure 9.19 lower left). In fact, as temperatures rise, the lower-grade forms of coal are actually being transformed from sedimentary to metamorphic rocks.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_288" style="width: 596px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=288"><img class="wp-image-288 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/coal.png" alt="" width="596" height="466" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/coal.png 596w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/coal-300x235.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/coal-65x51.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/coal-225x176.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/coal-350x274.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 9.19</strong> The formation of coal begins when plant matter is prevented from decaying by accumulating in low-oxygen, acidic water.

This is because they have only been deposited relatively recently — perhaps a few centuries or millennia ago — and will be re-eroded before they are buried deep enough beneath other sediments to be lithified. In order for sediments to be preserved long enough to be turned into rock (a process that takes millions or tens of millions of years) they need to have been deposited in a basin in which sediments can be preserved for that long.

There is a well-developed trench basin off the west coast of Vancouver Island.</p> <p>A <strong>forearc basin</strong> lies between the subduction zone and the volcanic arc, and may be formed in part by friction between the subducting plate and the overriding plate, which pulls part of the overriding plate down. The Strait of Georgia, the channel between Vancouver Island and the BC mainland, is a forearc basin.</p> <p>A <strong>foreland basin</strong> is caused by the mass of a mountain range depressing the crust.

The implication is that tilted sedimentary layers observed today must have been subjected to tectonic forces that tilted them.</li> <li>The <strong>principle of superposition</strong> states that sedimentary layers are deposited in sequence, and that unless the entire sequence has been turned over by tectonic processes, the layers at the bottom are older than those at the top.</li> <li>The <strong>principle of inclusions</strong> states that any rock fragments in a sedimentary layer must be older than the layer that contains them. For example, the cobbles in a conglomerate must have been formed before the conglomerate.</li> <li>The <strong>principle of faunal succession</strong> states that there is a well-defined order in which organisms have evolved through geological time, and therefore the identification of specific fossils in a rock can be used to determine its age.</li> </ul> <p>These and other principles are discussed in more detail in <a href="#chapter-19-2-relative-dating-methods-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chapter 19</a>.</p> <p>In addition to these principles that apply to all sedimentary rocks, a number of other important characteristics of sedimentary processes lead to the development of distinctive sedimentary features in specific sedimentary environments. By understanding the origins of these features, we can make some very useful inferences about the processes and depositional environment that ultimately resulted in the rocks that we are studying.</p> <p><strong>Bedding</strong> refers to sedimentary layers that can be distinguished from one another on the basis of characteristics such as texture, composition, colour, or weathering characteristics (Figure 9.22). They may also be similar layers separated by <strong>partings</strong>, narrow regions marking weaker surfaces where erosion is enhanced. Bedding is an indication of changes in depositional processes that may be related to seasonal differences, changes in climate, changes in locations of rivers or deltas, or tectonic changes. Bedding can form in almost any depositional environment.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_295" style="width: 604px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur.png"><img class="wp-image-295" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur.png" alt="" width="604" height="440" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur.png 769w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur-300x218.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur-768x559.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur-65x47.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur-225x164.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Sulphur-350x255.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 9.22</strong> Beds in the Triassic Sulphur Mt.

The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) (<a href="http://www.stratigraphy.org/">http://www.stratigraphy.org/</a>) has established a set of conventions for grouping, describing, and naming sedimentary rock units.</p> <p>The main stratigraphic unit is a <strong>formation</strong>. A formation is a series of beds that is distinct from other beds above and below, and is thick enough to be shown on the geological maps that are widely used within the area in question. In most parts of the world, geological mapping is done at a relatively coarse scale, and so most formations are on the order of a few hundred metres thick. At that thickness, a typical formation would appear on a typical geological map as an area that is at least a few millimetres thick.</p> <p>A series of formations can be classified together to define a <strong>group</strong>, which could be as much as a few thousand metres thick, and represents a series of rocks that were deposited within a single basin (or a series of related and adjacent basins) over millions to tens of millions of years.</p> <p>In areas where detailed geological information is needed (for example, within a mining or petroleum district) a formation might be divided into <strong>members</strong>, where each member has a specific and distinctive lithology (rock type). For example, a formation that includes both shale and sandstone might be divided into members, one of which is shale, and the other sandstone. In some areas, where even more detail is required, members may be divided into beds, but this is only applicable to beds that have a special geological significance. Groups, formations, and members are typically named for the area where they are found.</p> <p>The sedimentary rocks of the Nanaimo Group on Vancouver Island provide a useful example for understanding groups, formations, and members. During the latter part of the Cretaceous Period, from about 90 Ma to 65 Ma, a thick sequence of clastic rocks was deposited in a foreland basin between what is now Vancouver Island and the BC mainland (Figure 9.28). Nanaimo Group comprises a 5000 m thick sequence of conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone layers. Coal was mined from the Nanaimo Group rocks from around 1850 to 1950 in the Nanaimo region, and is still being mined in the Campbell River area.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_302" style="width: 549px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks.png"><img class="wp-image-302" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks.png" alt="" width="549" height="502" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks.png 801w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks-300x274.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks-768x702.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks-65x59.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks-225x206.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks-350x320.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 9.28</strong> The distribution of the Upper Cretaceous Nanaimo Group rocks on Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, and in the Vancouver area. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a>, modified after Mustard (1994).</em></div></div> <p>The Nanaimo Group is divided into 11 formations (Table 9.3).

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-9-summary-2" title="Chapter 9 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">62</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 9 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>9.1 Clastic Sedimentary Rocks</h3> <p>Sedimentary clasts are classified based on their size, and variations in clast size have important implications for transportation and deposition. Clastic sedimentary rocks range from conglomerate to mudstone. Clast size, sorting, composition, and shape are important features that allow us to differentiate clastic rocks and understand the processes that took place during their deposition.</p> <h3>9.2 Chemical and Biochemical Sedimentary Rocks</h3> <p>Chemical and biochemical sedimentary rocks form from ions that were transported in solution, and then converted into minerals by chemical and/or biological processes. The most common biochemical rock, limestone, typically forms in shallow tropical marine environments, where biological activity is a very important factor. Chert and banded iron formations can be from deep-ocean environments. Evaporites form where the waters of lakes and inland seas become supersaturated due to evaporation.</p> <h3>9.3 Organic Sedimentary Rocks</h3> <p>Organic sedimentary rocks contain abundant organic carbon molecules (molecules with carbon-hydrogen bonds). An example is coal, which forms when dead plant material is preserved in stagnant swamp water, and later compressed and heated.</p> <h3>9.4 Depositional Environments and Sedimentary Basins</h3> <p>There is a wide range of depositional environments, both on land (including glaciers, lakes, and rivers) and in the ocean (including deltas, reefs, shelves, and the deep-ocean floor). In order to be preserved, sediments must accumulate in sedimentary basins, many of which form through plate-tectonic processes.</p> <h3>9.5 Sedimentary Structures and Fossils</h3> <p>The deposition of sedimentary rocks can be described in terms of a series of principles, including original horizontality, superposition, and faunal succession. Sedimentary rocks can also have distinctive structures that are important in determining their depositional environments. Fossils are useful for determining the age of a rock, the depositional environment, and the climate at the time of deposition.</p> <h3>9.6 Groups, Formations, and Members</h3> <p>Sedimentary sequences are classified into groups, formations, and members so that they can be mapped easily and without confusion.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>What are the minimum and maximum sizes of sand grains?</li> <li>The material that makes up a rock such as conglomerate cannot be deposited by a slow-flowing river. Why?</li> <li>Describe the two main processes of lithification.</li> <li>What is the difference between a lithic arenite and a lithic wacke?</li> <li>How does a feldspathic arenite differ from a quartz arenite?</li> <li>What can we say about the source area lithology, and the weathering and transportation history of a sandstone that is primarily composed of rounded quartz grains?</li> <li>What is the original source of the carbon that is present within carbonate deposits such as limestone?</li> <li>What long-term environmental change on Earth led to the deposition of banded iron formations?</li> <li>Name two important terrestrial depositional environments and two important marine ones.</li> <li>What is the origin of a foreland basin, and how does it differ from a forearc basin?</li> <li>Explain the origins of  (a) bedding, (b) cross-bedding, (c) graded bedding, and (d) mud cracks.</li> <li>Under what conditions will reverse-graded bedding form?</li> <li>What are the criteria for the application of a formation name to a series of sedimentary rocks?</li> <li>Explain why some of the Nanaimo Group formations have been divided into members, while others have not.</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-answers-to-chapter-9-review-questions" title="Answers to Chapter 9 Review Questions"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">63</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Answers to Chapter 9 Review Questions</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>1. Sand grains range in size from 1/16 mm to 2 mm.</p> <p>2. Conglomerate cannot be deposited by a slow-flowing river because clasts larger than 2 mm are not transported by slow-moving water.</p> <p>3. Sediments are buried beneath other sediments where, because of the increased pressure, they become compacted and water is forced out from between the grains. With additional burial they are warmed to the point where cementing minerals can form between the grains (less than 200˚C).</p> <p>4. Lithic arenite has less than 15% silt- and clay-sized particles, while a lithic wacke has more than 15%. Both have more than 10% rock fragments and more rock fragments than feldspar.</p> <p>5. Feldspathic arenite has more than 10% feldspar and more feldspar than rock fragments. Quartz arenite has less than 10% feldspar and less than 10% rock fragments. Both have less than 15% silt and clay.</p> <p>6. Source area lithology: rock that contains quartz (such as granite or sandstone). Strong weathering is required to remove feldspar, and long fluvial transportation to round the grains.</p> <p>7. The carbon within carbonate deposits such as limestone ultimately comes from the atmosphere.</p> <p>8. Most of Earth’s banded iron formations formed during the initial oxygenation of the atmosphere between 2.4 and 1.8 Ga because iron that had been soluble in the anoxic oceans became insoluble in the oxidized oceans.</p> <p>9. Terrestrial depositional environments: rivers, lakes, deltas, deserts, glaciers. Marine depositional environments: continental shelves, continental slopes, deep ocean.</p> <p>10. A foreland basin forms in the vicinity of a large range of mountains where the weight of the mountains depresses the crust on either side. A forearc basin lies between a subduction zone and the related volcanic arc.</p> <p>11. (a) Bedding forms where there is an interruption or change in the depositional process, or a change in the composition of the material being deposited. (b) Cross-bedding forms in fluvial or aeolian environments where sand-sized sediments are being moved and ripples or dunes are present. (c) Graded bedding forms when transport energy decreases, depositing finer and finer particles. (d) Mud cracks form where fine-grained sediments (silt or clay) are allowed to dry.</p> <p>12. Reverse-graded bedding forms during gravity flows, such as debris flows.</p> <p>13. A formation is a series of beds that is distinct from other beds above and below it, and is thick enough to be shown on the geological maps that are widely used within the area in question.</p> <p>14. The Nanaimo Group was actively mined for coal for many decades. During that time the names were given to members and individual beds that were important to the coal miners.</p> </div></div>

New metamorphic rocks can form from old ones as pressure and temperature progressively increase. The term <em>parent rock</em> is typically applied to the initial unmetamorphosed rock, rather than referring to each metamorphic rock that formed as metamorphism progresses.&nbsp; We don’t always know whether metamorphism occurred in an uninterrupted sequence or whether metamorphism stopped and started again for different reasons at different times.</p> <p>Metamorphic rocks form under pressures and temperatures that are higher than those experienced by sedimentary rocks during diagenesis, but at temperatures lower than those that cause igneous rocks to melt.&nbsp; Given that pressure and water content affect the temperature at which rocks melt, metamorphism can occur at higher temperatures for some kinds of rocks, whereas other rocks will begin to melt under these same conditions. Metamorphic rocks can have very different mineral assemblages and textures than their parent rocks (Figure 10.2), but their over-all chemical composition usually does not change very much.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2677" style="width: 599px"><a href="#part-chapter-10-metamorphism-and-metamorphic-rocks-3rd"><img class="wp-image-2677" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/shale_gneiss.png" alt="" width="599" height="272" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/shale_gneiss.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/shale_gneiss-300x136.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/shale_gneiss-65x30.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/shale_gneiss-225x102.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/06/shale_gneiss-350x159.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.2</strong> Shale is the parent rock of gneiss (pronounced “nice”).

Metamorphism can also take place if cold rock near the surface is intruded and heated by a hot igneous body. Metamorphism usually involves temperatures above 150°C, but some types of metamorphism do occur at temperatures lower than those at which the parent rock formed.</p></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-10-1-controls-on-metamorphic-processes-2" title="10.1 Controls on Metamorphic Processes"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">64</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">10.1 Controls on Metamorphic Processes</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The main factors that control metamorphic processes are:</p> <ul><li>The chemical composition of the parent rock</li> <li>The temperature at which metamorphism takes place</li> <li>The pressure applied, and whether the pressure is equal in all directions or not</li> <li>The amount and type of fluid (mostly water) that is present during metamorphism</li> <li>The amount of time over which metamorphic conditions are sustained</li> </ul> <h1>Mineral composition</h1> <p>Parent rocks can be from any of the three rock types: sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic.  The critical feature of the parent rock is its mineral composition.  This is because the stability of minerals—how they are influenced by changing conditions—is what determines which minerals form as metamorphism takes place. When a rock is subjected to increased temperatures and pressures, some minerals will undergo chemical reactions and turn into new minerals, while others might just change their size and shape.</p> <h1>Temperature</h1> <p>The temperature under which metamorphism occurs is a key variable in determining which metamorphic reactions happen. Mineral stability depends on temperature, pressure, and the presence of fluids. Minerals are stable over a specific range of temperatures. Quartz, for example, is stable from surface temperatures up to approximately 1800°C. If the pressure is higher, that upper limit will also be higher. If there is water present, it will be lower. Most other common minerals have upper limits between 150°C and 1000°C.</p> <p>Some minerals will change their crystal structure depending on the temperature and pressure. Quartz has different polymorphs that are stable between 0°C and 1800°C. The minerals kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite are polymorphs with the composition Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>. The fact that they are stable at different pressures and temperatures means that their presence can be used to determine the pressures and temperatures experienced by a metamorphic rock that contains one or more of the polymorphs (Figure 10.3).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2682" style="width: 602px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Al2SiO5.png"><img class="wp-image-2682" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Al2SiO5.png" alt="" width="602" height="625" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Al2SiO5.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Al2SiO5-289x300.png 289w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Al2SiO5-65x68.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Al2SiO5-225x234.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Al2SiO5-350x364.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.3</strong> The Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub> polymorphs andalusite, kyanite, and sillimanite, and their stability fields. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY-SA 4.0.

When <strong>directed pressure</strong> (or <strong>directed stress</strong>) acts on a rock, it means the stress on the rock is much greater in one direction than another. In an experiment with cylinders of modeling clay stacked in a block (Figure 10.4, top), pushing down on the clay from above resulted in higher directed pressure in the up-down direction (larger arrows; downward from pushing on the clay, and upward from the force of the table beneath the clay) than in the sideways direction, where only air pressure was acting (small arrows). The clay cylinders became elongated in the direction of least pressure.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2694" style="width: 596px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/clay-experiment.png"><img class="wp-image-2694" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/clay-experiment.png" alt="" width="596" height="480" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/clay-experiment.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/clay-experiment-300x242.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/clay-experiment-65x52.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/clay-experiment-225x181.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/clay-experiment-350x282.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.4</strong> Modelling clay experiments showing the effects of pressure on textures.

In another modelling-clay experiment, applying oppositely directed forces to the top and bottom of a block of clay (Figure 10.4, bottom) caused diagonal stretching within the block. Note the change in shape of the dashed white reference circles.</p> <p>In both experiments, parts of the clay became elongated in a particular direction. When mineral grains within a rock become aligned like this, it produces a fabric called <strong>foliation</strong>. Foliation is described in more detail later in this chapter.</p> <h1>Fluids</h1> <p>Water is the main fluid present within rocks of the crust, and the only one considered here. The presence of water is important for two main reasons. First, water facilitates the transfer of ions between minerals and within minerals, and therefore increases the rates at which metamorphic reactions take place. This speeds the process up so metamorphism might occur more rapidly, or metamorphic processes that might not otherwise have had time to be completed are completed.</p> <p>Secondly, water—especially hot water—can have elevated concentrations of dissolved substances, making it an important medium for moving ions from one place to another within the crust. Processes facilitated by hot water are called <strong>hydrothermal</strong> processes (<em>hydro</em> refers to water, and <em>thermal</em> refers to heat)<em>.<br /> </em></p> <h1>Time</h1> <p>Most metamorphic reactions occur very slowly. Estimates of the growth rates of new minerals within a rock during metamorphism suggest that new material is added to the outside of mineral crystals at a rate of approximately 1 mm per million years. Very slow reaction rates make it difficult to study metamorphic processes in a lab.</p> <p>While the rate of metamorphism is slow, the tectonic processes that lead to metamorphism are also very slow, so there is a good chance that metamorphic reactions will be completed. For example, an important setting for metamorphism is many kilometres deep within the roots of mountain ranges. A mountain range takes tens of millions of years to form, and tens of millions of years more to be eroded to the extent that we can see the rocks that were metamorphosed deep beneath it.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title" style="text-align: center">Exercise: How Long Did It Take?</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>The large reddish crystals in Figure 10.5 are garnet, and the surrounding light coloured rock is dominated by muscovite mica.

The stress that produced this pattern was greatest in the direction indicated by the black arrows, at a right angle to the orientation of the minerals. The aligned minerals are mostly mica, which has a platy crystal habit, with plates stacked together like pages in a book.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2716" style="width: 507px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2716"><img class="wp-image-2716" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/foliation-and-crystal-habit.png" alt="" width="507" height="433" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/foliation-and-crystal-habit.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/foliation-and-crystal-habit-300x256.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/foliation-and-crystal-habit-65x56.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/foliation-and-crystal-habit-225x192.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/foliation-and-crystal-habit-350x299.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.9</strong> A foliated metamorphic rock called phyllite (upper left).

Not only is the mineral composition different—it is quartz, not mica—but the crystals are not aligned. The quartz crystals were subjected to the same stress as the mica crystals, but because quartz grows in blocky shapes rather than elongated ones, the crystals could not be aligned in any one direction.</p> <p>Even though the quartz crystals themselves are not aligned, the mass of quartz crystals forms a lens that does follow the general trend of alignment within the rock. This happens because the stress can cause some parts of the quartz crystals to dissolve, and the resulting ions flow away at right angles to the greatest stress before forming crystals again.</p> <p>The effects of recrystallization in Figure 10.9 would not be visible with the unaided eye, but when larger crystals or large clasts are involved, the effects can be visible as &#8220;shadows&#8221; or &#8220;wings&#8221; around crystals and clasts. The rock in Figure 10.10 had a quartz-rich conglomerate as a parent rock. Differential stress has caused quartz pebbles within the rock to become elongated, and it has also caused wings to form around some of the pebbles (see the pebble in the dashed ellipse). The location of the wings depends on the distribution of stress on the rock (Figure 10.10, upper right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2783" style="width: 606px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2783" rel="attachment wp-att-2783"><img class="wp-image-2783" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/metaconglomerate.png" alt="" width="606" height="344" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/metaconglomerate.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/metaconglomerate-300x170.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/metaconglomerate-65x37.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/metaconglomerate-225x128.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/metaconglomerate-350x199.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.10</strong> Metaconglomerate with elongated of quartz pebbles.

This forms planes of weakness, and when these rocks break, they tend to break along surfaces that parallel the orientation of the aligned minerals (Figure 10.11). Breaks along planes of weakness within a rock that are caused by foliation are referred to as <strong>rock</strong> <strong>cleavage</strong>, or just cleavage.  This is distinct from cleavage in minerals because mineral cleavage happens between atoms within a mineral, but rock cleavage happens between minerals.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2722" style="width: 555px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/cleavage-close-up.png"><img class="wp-image-2722" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/cleavage-close-up.png" alt="" width="555" height="175" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/cleavage-close-up.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/cleavage-close-up-300x95.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/cleavage-close-up-65x20.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/cleavage-close-up-225x71.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/cleavage-close-up-350x110.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.11</strong> Close-up view of a metamorphic rock with aligned elongated crystals.

They can also form when the parent rock consists of blocky minerals such as quartz and calcite, in which individual crystals do not align because they aren’t longer in any one dimension. This distinction breaks down in zones of intense deformation, where even minerals like quartz can be squeezed into long stringers, much like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube (Figure 10.13).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2732" style="width: 864px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2732"><img class="wp-image-2732 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/mylonite-with-plastic-defm-of-qtz.png" alt="" width="864" height="289" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/mylonite-with-plastic-defm-of-qtz.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/mylonite-with-plastic-defm-of-qtz-300x100.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/mylonite-with-plastic-defm-of-qtz-768x257.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/mylonite-with-plastic-defm-of-qtz-65x22.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/mylonite-with-plastic-defm-of-qtz-225x75.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/mylonite-with-plastic-defm-of-qtz-350x117.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.13</strong> Rocks from the Western Carpathians mountain range without deformation (left) and after deformation (right).

Each of these has a characteristic type of foliation</p> <h2>Slate</h2> <p>Slate (Figure 10.14) forms from the low-grade metamorphism of shale. Slate has microscopic clay and mica crystals that have grown perpendicular to the maximum stress direction. Slate tends to break into flat sheets or plates, a property described as slaty cleavage.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2737" style="width: 607px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/slate.png"><img class="wp-image-2737" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/slate.png" alt="" width="607" height="370" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/slate.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/slate-300x183.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/slate-65x40.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/slate-225x137.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/slate-350x213.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.14</strong> Slate, a low-grade foliated metamorphic rock.

As a result, the micas have grown larger.  They still are not visible as individual crystals, but the larger size leads to a satiny sheen on the surface.  The cleavage of phyllite is slightly wavy compared to that of slate.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2739" style="width: 595px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/phyllite.png"><img class="wp-image-2739" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/phyllite.png" alt="" width="595" height="368" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/phyllite.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/phyllite-300x186.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/phyllite-65x40.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/phyllite-225x139.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/phyllite-350x217.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.15</strong> Phyllite, a fine-grained foliated metamorphic rock.

Individual crystal faces may flash when the sample is turned in the light, making the rock appear to sparkle. Other minerals such as garnet might also be visible, but it is not unusual to find that schist consists predominantly of a single mineral.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2748" style="width: 403px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2748"><img class="wp-image-2748" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/schist.png" alt="" width="403" height="452" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/schist.png 576w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/schist-267x300.png 267w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/schist-65x73.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/schist-225x252.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/schist-350x393.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.16</strong> Schist, a medium- to high-grade foliated metamorphic rock.

Gneiss features minerals that have separated into bands of different colours. The bands of colours are what define foliation within gneiss. Sometimes the bands are very obvious and continuous (Figure 10.17, upper right), but sometimes they are more like lenses (upper left). Dark bands are largely amphibole while the light-coloured bands are feldspar and quartz. Most gneiss has little or no mica because it forms at temperatures higher than those under which micas are stable.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2756" style="width: 433px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2756"><img class="wp-image-2756" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/gneiss.png" alt="" width="433" height="407" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/gneiss.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/gneiss-300x282.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/gneiss-65x61.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/gneiss-225x211.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/gneiss-350x329.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.17</strong> Gneiss, a coarse-grained, high grade metamorphic rock, is characterized by colour bands.

One derived from shale may be a muscovite-biotite schist, or just a mica schist, or if there are garnets present it might be mica-garnet schist. Similarly, gneiss that originated as basalt and is dominated by amphibole, is an amphibole gneiss or <strong>amphibolite </strong>(Figure 10.18).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_318" style="width: 381px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=318"><img class="wp-image-318" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/amphibolite_pm20-28-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="286" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/amphibolite_pm20-28-300x225.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/amphibolite_pm20-28-300x225-65x49.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/amphibolite_pm20-28-300x225-225x169.jpg 225w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.18</strong> Amphibolite in thin section (2mm field of view), derived from metamorphism of a mafic igneous rock.

In most cases, this is because they are not buried deeply enough, and the heat for the metamorphism comes from a body of magma that has moved into the upper part of the crust. Metamorphism that happens because of proximity to magma is called <strong>contact metamorphism</strong>. Some examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks are <strong>marble</strong>, <strong>quartzite</strong>, and <strong>hornfels</strong>.</p> <h2>Marble</h2> <p>Marble (Figure 10.19) is metamorphosed limestone. When it forms, the calcite crystals <strong>recrystallize</strong> (re-form into larger blocky calcite crystals), and any sedimentary textures and fossils that might have been present are destroyed. If the original limestone is pure calcite, then the marble will be white.  On the other hand, if it has impurities such as clay, silica, or magnesium, the marble could be “marbled” in appearance (Figure 10.19, bottom).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2763" style="width: 480px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2763" rel="attachment wp-att-2763"><img class="wp-image-2763" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/marble.png" alt="" width="480" height="394" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/marble.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/marble-300x246.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/marble-65x53.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/marble-225x185.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/marble-350x287.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.19</strong> Marble is a non-foliated metamorphic rock with a limestone protolith.

It is dominated by quartz, and in many cases, the original quartz grains of the sandstone are welded together with additional silica. Sandstone often contains some clay minerals, feldspar or lithic fragments, so quartzite can also contain impurities.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2768" style="width: 622px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2768" rel="attachment wp-att-2768"><img class="wp-image-2768" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/quartzite.png" alt="" width="622" height="289" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/quartzite.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/quartzite-300x139.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/quartzite-65x30.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/quartzite-225x105.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/quartzite-350x163.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.20</strong> Quartzite is a non-foliated metamorphic rock with a sandstone protolith.

On the other hand, any clay present in the original sandstone is likely to be converted to mica during metamorphism, and any such mica is likely to align with the directional pressure.</p> <h2>Hornfels</h2> <p>Hornfels is another non-foliated metamorphic rock that normally forms during contact metamorphism of fine-grained rocks like mudstone or volcanic rocks. Hornfels have different elongated or platy minerals (e.g., micas, pyroxene, amphibole, and others) depending on the exact conditions and the parent rock, yet because the pressure wasn&#8217;t substantially higher in any particular direction, these crystals remain randomly oriented.</p> <p>The hornfels in Figure 10.21 (left) appears to have gneiss-like bands, but these actually reflect the beds of alternating sandstone and shale that were in the protolith. They are not related to alignment of crystals due to metamorphism. On the right of Figure 10.21 is a microscopic view of another sample of hornfels, also from a sedimentary protolith. The dark band at the top is from the original bedding.  Here you can see that the brown mica crystals (biotite) are not aligned.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_322" style="width: 559px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=322"><img class="wp-image-322" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/hornfels.png" alt="" width="559" height="252" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/hornfels.png 714w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/hornfels-300x135.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/hornfels-65x29.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/hornfels-225x101.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/hornfels-350x158.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.21</strong> Hornfels, a non-foliated metamorphic rock formed from a fine-grained protolith.

Sandstone and limestone don’t change much either because their metamorphic forms (quartzite and marble, respectively) have the same mineral composition, but re-formed larger crystals.</p> <p>On the other hand, some rocks can change substantially.  Mudrock (e.g., shale, mudstone) can start out as slate, then progress through phyllite, schist, and gneiss, with a variety of different minerals forming along the way.  Schist and gneiss can also form from sandstone, conglomerate, and a range of both volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks.</p> <h1>Migmatite: Both Metamorphic and Igneous</h1> <p>If a metamorphic rock is heated enough, it can begin to undergo partial melting in the same way that igneous rocks do.  The more felsic minerals (feldspar, quartz) will melt, while the more mafic minerals (biotite, hornblende) do not.  When the melt crystallizes again, the result is light-coloured igneous rock interspersed with dark-coloured metamorphic rock.  This mixed rock is called <strong>migmatite</strong> (Figure 10.22).

As metamorphic processes go, burial metamorphism takes place at relatively low temperatures (up to ~300 °C) and pressures (100s of m depth). To the unaided eye, metamorphic changes may not be apparent at all.

It is common to use the terms <em>granite</em> and <em>marble</em> to describe rocks that are neither. While these terms might not provide accurate information about the rock type, they generally do distinguish natural rock from synthetic materials. An example of a synthetic material is the one referred to as <em>quartz</em>, which includes ground-up quartz crystals as well as resin. If you happen to be in the market for stone countertops and are concerned about getting a natural product, it is best to ask lots of questions.</p> </div> <h1>Regional Metamorphism</h1> <p>Regional metamorphism refers to large-scale metamorphism, such as what happens to continental crust along convergent tectonic margins (where plates collide).&nbsp; The collisions result in the formation of long mountain ranges, like those along the western coast of North America.&nbsp; The force of the collision causes rocks to be folded, broken, and stacked on each other, so not only is there the squeezing force from the collision, but from the weight of stacked rocks. The deeper rocks are within the stack, the higher the pressures and temperatures, and the higher the grade of metamorphism that occurs. Rocks that form from regional metamorphism are likely to be foliated because of the strong directional pressure of converging plates.</p> <p>The Himalaya range is an example of where regional metamorphism is happening because two continents are colliding (Figure 10.25). Sedimentary rocks have been both thrust up to great heights—nearly 9 km above sea level—and also buried to great depths. Considering that the normal geothermal gradient (the rate of increase in temperature with depth) is around 30°C per kilometre in the crust, rock buried to 9 km below sea level in this situation could be close to 18 km below the surface of the ground, and it is reasonable to expect temperatures up to 500°C. Notice the sequence of rocks that from, beginning with slate higher up where pressures and temperatures are lower, and ending in migmatite at the bottom where temperatures are so high that some of the minerals start to melt. These rocks are all foliated because of the strong compressing force of the converging plates.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2792" style="width: 501px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2792" rel="attachment wp-att-2792"><img class="wp-image-2792" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/regionalmeta.png" alt="" width="501" height="360" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/regionalmeta.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/regionalmeta-300x215.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/regionalmeta-65x47.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/regionalmeta-225x162.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/regionalmeta-350x251.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.25</strong> Regional metamorphism beneath a mountain range resulting from continent-continent collision.

Heat is important in contact metamorphism, but pressure is not a key factor, so contact metamorphism produces non-foliated metamorphic rocks such as hornfels, marble, and quartzite.</p> <p>Any type of magma body can lead to contact metamorphism, from a thin dyke to a large stock. The type and intensity of the metamorphism, and width of the metamorphic <strong>aureole</strong> that develops around the magma body, will depend on a number of factors, including the type of country rock, the temperature of the intruding body, the size of the body, and the volatile compounds within the body (Figure 10.30). A large intrusion will contain more thermal energy and will cool much more slowly than a small one, and therefore will provide a longer time and more heat for metamorphism. This will allow the heat to extend farther into the country rock, creating a larger aureole. Volatiles may exsolve from the intruding melt and travel into the country rock, facilitating heating and carrying chemical constituents from the melt into the rock. Thus, aureoles that form around “wet” intrusions tend to be larger than those forming around their dry counterparts.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_334" style="width: 290px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image032-290x300.png"><img class="wp-image-334 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image032-290x300.png" alt="" width="290" height="300" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image032-290x300.png 290w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image032-290x300-65x67.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/image032-290x300-225x233.png 225w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.30</strong> Schematic cross-section of the middle and upper crust showing two magma bodies.

Contact metamorphism can take place over a wide range of temperatures—from around 300 °C to over 800 °C. Different minerals will form depending on the exact temperature and the nature of the country rock.</p> <p>Although bodies of magma can form in a variety of settings, one place magma is produced in abundance, and where contact metamorphism can take place, is along convergent boundaries with subduction zones, where volcanic arcs form (Figure 10.31). Regional metamorphism also takes place in this setting, and because of the extra heat associated with the magmatic activity, the geothermal gradient is typically steeper in these settings (between ~40 and 50 °C/km).

Dynamic metamorphism occurs at relatively low temperatures compared to other types of metamorphism, and consists predominantly of the physical changes that happen to a rock experiencing shear stress. It affects a narrow region near the fault, and rocks nearby may appear unaffected.</p> <p>At lower pressures and temperatures, dynamic metamorphism will have the effect of breaking and grinding rock, creating <strong>cataclastic rocks</strong> such as <strong>fault breccia</strong> (Figure 10.33). At higher pressures and temperatures, grains and crystals in the rock may deform without breaking into pieces (Figure 10.34, left). The outcome of prolonged dynamic metamorphism under these conditions is a rock called <strong>mylonite</strong>, in which crystals have been stretched into thin ribbons (Figure 10.34, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2821" style="width: 605px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2821" rel="attachment wp-att-2821"><img class="wp-image-2821" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/fault_breccia.png" alt="" width="605" height="309" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/fault_breccia.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/fault_breccia-300x153.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/fault_breccia-65x33.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/fault_breccia-225x115.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/fault_breccia-350x179.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.33</strong> Fault breccia, created when shear stress along a fault breaks up rocks.

A convenient way to indicate the range of possible metamorphic rocks in a particular setting is to group those possibilities into <strong>metamorphic facies</strong>. In other words, a given metamorphic facies groups together metamorphic rocks that form under the same pressure and temperature conditions, but which have different protoliths.</p> <p>Figure 10.35 shows the different metamorphic facies as patches of different colours. The axes on the diagram are temperature and depth; the depth within the Earth will determine how much pressure a rock is under, so the vertical depth axis is also a pressure axis. Each patch of colour represents a range of temperature and pressure conditions where particular types of metamorphic rocks will form. Metamorphic facies are named for rocks that form under specific conditions (e.g., eclogite facies, amphibolite facies etc.), but those names don&#8217;t mean that the facies is limited to that one rock type.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2812" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2812" rel="attachment wp-att-2812"><img class="size-full wp-image-2812" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/facies_metatypes.png" alt="" width="720" height="562" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/facies_metatypes.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/facies_metatypes-300x234.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/facies_metatypes-65x51.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/facies_metatypes-225x176.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/facies_metatypes-350x273.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.35</strong> Metamorphic facies and types of metamorphism shown in the context of depth and temperature.

The yellow, green, and blue dashed lines represent the geothermal gradients in different environments. Recall that the geothermal gradient describes how rapidly the temperature increases with depth in Earth. In most areas (green dashed line), the rate of increase in temperature with depth is 30 °C/km. In other words, if you go 1,000 m down into a mine, the temperature will be roughly 30 °C warmer than the average temperature at the surface.  In volcanic areas (yellow dashed line), the geothermal gradient is more like 40 to 50 °C/km, so the temperature rises much faster as you go down. Along subduction zones (blue dashed line), the cold ocean lithosphere keeps temperatures low, so the gradient is typically less than 10 °C/km.</p> <p>The yellow, green, and blue dashed lines in Figure 10.35 tell you what metamorphic facies you will encounter for rocks from a given depth in that particular environment. A depth of 15 km in a volcanic region falls in the amphibolite facies.  Under more typical conditions, this is the greenschist facies, and in a subduction zone it is the blueschist facies. You can make the connection more directly between the metamorphic facies and the types of metamorphism discussed in the previous section by matching up the letters <em>a</em> through <em>e</em> in Figure 10.35 with the labels in Figure 10.36.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2816" style="width: 864px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2816" rel="attachment wp-att-2816"><img class="size-full wp-image-2816" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/meta_locations.png" alt="" width="864" height="271" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/meta_locations.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/meta_locations-300x94.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/meta_locations-768x241.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/meta_locations-65x20.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/meta_locations-225x71.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/meta_locations-350x110.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.36</strong> Environments of metamorphism in the context of plate tectonics: (a) regional metamorphism related to mountain building at a continent-continent convergent boundary, (b) seafloor (hydrothermal) metamorphism of oceanic crust in the area on either side of a spreading ridge, (c) metamorphism of oceanic crustal rocks within a subduction zone, (d) contact metamorphism adjacent to a magma body at a high level in the crust, and (e) regional metamorphism related to mountain building at a convergent boundary. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0, modified after Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image019.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>One other line to notice in Figure 10.35 is the red dashed line on the right-hand side of the figure.

A metamorphic zone is a region bounded by the first appearance of an index mineral. In the Meguma Terrane, the biotite zone (Figure 10.38, darker green) begins in the east and north with the first appearance of biotite. The biotite zone ends toward the south and west where garnet first appears. Because index minerals can have overlapping stability conditions, a lower-intensity index mineral can still be present in a higher-intensity metamorphic zone.</p> <p>Knowledge of metamorphic zones makes it possible to draw conclusions about the geological conditions in which metamorphic rocks formed. The highest-intensity metamorphism—the sillimanite zone—is in the southwest. Progressively lower grades of metamorphism exist toward the east and north. The rocks of the sillimanite zone were likely heated to over 700 °C, and therefore must have been buried to depths between 20 km and 25 km. The surrounding lower-grade rocks were not buried as deeply, and the rocks within the peripheral chlorite zone were likely not buried to more than about 5 km depth.</p> <p>A probable explanation for this pattern is that the area with the highest-grade rocks was buried beneath the central part of a mountain range formed by the collision of the Meguma Terrane with North America. The collision caused rocks to be folded, and to be faulted and stacked on top of each other. These mountain-building processes thickened Earth&#8217;s crust, and increased its mass locally as the mountains grew. The increased mass of the growing mountains caused the lithosphere to float lower in the mantle (Figure 10.39, left). As the mountains were eventually eroded over tens of millions of years, the crust floated higher and higher in the mantle, and erosion exposed metamorphic rocks that were deep within the mountains (Figure 10.39, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2833" style="width: 694px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario.png"><img class="wp-image-2833" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario.png" alt="" width="694" height="285" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario-300x123.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario-768x316.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario-65x27.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario-225x92.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Meguma_scenario-350x144.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.39</strong> Schematic cross-section through the Meguma Terrane.

In the simplest cases, water does not play a big role, and the main process is heat transfer from the pluton to the surrounding rock, creating a zone of contact metamorphism (Figure 10.41a). In many cases, however, water is released from the magma body as crystallization takes place, and this water is dispersed along fractures in the surrounding rock (Figure 10.41b). The water released from a magma chamber is typically rich in dissolved minerals. As this water cools, it interacts with the surrounding rocks, changing both the chemistry of the water and the chemistry of the rocks. This can cause minerals to precipitate from the water. Minerals can also precipitate if the water boils because of a drop in pressure. The precipitated minerals form veins within fractures in the surrounding rock. Quartz veins are commonly formed in this situation, and can include other minerals such as pyrite, hematite, calcite, and even silver and gold.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_346" style="width: 652px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton.png"><img class="wp-image-346" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton-1024x350.png" alt="" width="652" height="223" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton-1024x350.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton-300x103.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton-768x263.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton-65x22.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton-225x77.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton-350x120.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 10.41</strong> Metamorphism and alteration around a pluton in the upper crust.

Magmatic fluids rich in silica, calcium, magnesium, iron, and other elements can dramatically change the chemistry of the limestone, forming minerals that would not normally exist in either the igneous rock or limestone.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-10-summary-2" title="Chapter 10 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">70</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 10 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>10.1 Controls on Metamorphic Processes</h3> <p>Metamorphism is controlled by five main factors: the composition of the parent rock, the temperature to which the rock is heated, the amount and direction of pressure, the volumes and compositions of fluids that are present, and the amount of time available for metamorphic reactions to take place.</p> <h3>10.2 Foliation and Rock Cleavage</h3> <p>When the pressure acting on a rock is not uniform in all directions, foliation can develop. Foliation may occur in the form of platy or elongated mineral crystals that have grown at right angles to the maximum pressure, or it may develop when crystals or clasts within a rock are deformed. Foliation causes crystals or clasts within a rock to become aligned. When metamorphic rocks break parallel to the direction of foliation, rock cleavage results.</p> <h3>10.3 Classification of Metamorphic Rocks</h3> <p>Metamorphic rocks are classified on the basis of texture and mineral composition. Foliation is a key feature of metamorphic rocks formed under directed pressure; foliated metamorphic rocks include slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss. Metamorphic rocks formed in environments without strong directed pressure include hornfels, marble, and quartzite.</p> <h3>10.4 Types of Metamorphism and Where They Occur</h3> <p>Almost all regions that experience metamorphism are being acted upon by plate-tectonic processes. Oceanic crustal rock can be metamorphosed near the spreading ridge where it was formed. Regional metamorphism takes place in areas where mountain ranges are forming, which are most common at convergent boundaries. Contact metamorphism takes place around magma bodies in the crust, which are also most common above convergent boundaries. Shock metamorphism happens when extraterrestrial bodies impact Earth, and is unusual among metamorphic processes because it occurs in seconds or minutes, rather than taking millions of years. Dynamic metamorphism occurs when shear stress is applied to rocks, such as along faults.</p> <h3>10.5 Metamorphic Facies and Index Minerals</h3> <p>Metamorphic facies are groups of metamorphic rocks that form under the same range of pressure and temperature conditions, but from different parent rocks. Geologists use index minerals such as chlorite, garnet, andalusite, and sillimanite to identify metamorphic zones. Index minerals tell us about the pressure and temperature conditions under which metamorphic rocks formed.</p> <h3>10.6 Metamorphic Hydrothermal Processes and Metasomatism</h3> <p>Contact metamorphism takes place around magma bodies that have intruded into cool rocks in the crust. Heat from magma is transferred to the surrounding country rock, resulting in mineralogical and textural changes. Hot water from a cooling body of magma, or from convection of groundwater driven by the heat of the pluton, can lead to hydrothermal alteration. When large volumes of fluid are flushed through rocks experiencing metamorphic pressures and temperatures, metasomatism results. Metasomatism can cause valuable metals to accumulate in the surrounding rocks.</p> <h1>Review Questions</h1> <ol><li>What are the two main agents of metamorphism, and what are their respective roles in producing metamorphic rocks?</li> <li>What types of metamorphic rocks will form if a mudrock experiences very low, low, medium, and high-grade metamorphism?</li> <li>Why doesn’t granite change very much at lower metamorphic grades?</li> <li>Describe the main process of foliation development in a metamorphic rock such as schist.</li> <li>What process contributes to metamorphism of oceanic crust at a spreading ridge?</li> <li>How do variations in the geothermal gradient affect the depth at which different metamorphic rocks form?</li> <li>Blueschist metamorphism takes place within subduction zones. What are the particular temperature and pressure characteristics of this geological setting?</li> <li>Rearrange the following minerals in order of increasing metamorphic grade: biotite, garnet, sillimanite, chlorite.</li> <li>What is the role of magmatic fluids in the metamorphism that takes place adjacent to a pluton?</li> <li>How does metasomatism differ from regional metamorphism?</li> <li>How does the presence of a hot pluton contribute to metasomatism?</li> <li>What determines whether metasomatism will produce skarn?</li> <li>For each of the following metamorphic rocks, indicate the likely parent rock and the grade and/or type of metamorphism: chlorite schist, slate, mica-garnet schist, amphibolite, marble.</li> </ol> </div></div>

Heat leads to mineralogical changes in the rock. Pressure also influences those mineralogical changes, while directed pressure (greater pressure in one direction) leads to foliation.</li> <li>Very low grade: slate; low grade: phyllite; medium grade: schist; high grade: gneiss.</li> <li>Granite remains largely unchanged at lower metamorphic grades because its minerals are still stable at those lower temperatures.</li> <li>Foliation develops in schist when new platy minerals grow with their longest dimension at a right angle to the direction of greatest pressure.</li> <li>At a spreading ridge the heat from volcanism leads to the development of a groundwater convection system in the rock of the oceanic crust. Heated water rises in the hot regions and is expelled into the ocean, while cold ocean water is drawn into the crust to replace it. The heated water leads to the conversion of olivine and pyroxene into chlorite and serpentine.</li> <li>The geothermal gradient varies as a function of tectonic setting, being greatest in volcanic regions and lowest along subduction zones. As a result the depth at which specific metamorphic grades is achieved will vary: the depth will be greater when the gradient is lower.</li> <li>The geothermal gradient is low within subduction zones because the cold subducting oceanic crust takes a long time to heat up.

However, there are other reasons why we should know more about volcanoes. One reason is that studying volcanoes helps us understand the evolution of the Earth system- not just Earth’s geological features, but past changes in climate, and even the causes of mass extinctions. Another reason is the critical need to study the hazards posed by volcanoes to people and infrastructure. Over the past few decades, volcanologists have made great strides in their ability to forecast volcanic eruptions and predict the consequences, saving thousands of lives.</p></div>

When volcanoes erupt, magma moves upward from a <strong>magma chamber </strong>and into a <strong>vent </strong>or conduit. It flows out from a crater at the top, or sometimes emerges at a secondary site on the side of the volcano resulting in a <strong>flank eruption</strong>. Erupted materials accumulate around the vent forming a volcanic mountain. The accumulated material might consist of layers of solidified lava, called <strong>lava flows</strong>, but it might also include fragments of various sizes that have been thrown from the volcano.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_765" style="width: 1527px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano.png" alt="" class="wp-image-765 size-full" width="1527" height="1015" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano.png 1527w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano-300x199.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano-768x510.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano-1024x681.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano-65x43.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano-225x150.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano-350x233.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 11.4</strong> The parts of a volcano (not to scale). <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2017) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <h2>Crater or Caldera?</h2> <p>A <strong>crater</strong> is the basin above a volcano’s vent. Craters have diameters on the scale of 10s to 100s of metres. A <strong>caldera </strong>is a bowl-shaped structure that resembles a crater, but it is much larger (km in scale) and forms when a volcano collapses in on itself. The process is illustrated in Figure 11.5, going from left to right. It begins when an eruption occurs, and the magma chamber beneath the volcano is drained. If a significant part of a volcano’s mass is supported by magma within the chamber, then depleting the magma also reduces the support for the volcano. The loss of support causes part of the volcano to collapse into the void in the magma chamber, leaving behind a broad basin rimmed by the remnants of the volcano. Over time, the basin can fill with water. If there is still activity within the magma chamber, magma may force its way upward again, causing the floor of the caldera to be lifted, or erupting to form a new volcano within the caldera.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_769" style="width: 1770px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Caldera_USGS.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/Caldera_USGS.png" alt="Formation of a caldera.

At high pressures, the gases are dissolved within magma. However, if the pressure decreases, the gas comes out of solution, forming bubbles. This process is analogous to what happens when a pop bottle is opened. Pop is bottled under pressure, forcing carbon dioxide gas to dissolve into the fluid. As a result, a bottle of pop that you find on the supermarket shelf will have few to no bubbles. If you open the bottle, you decrease the pressure within it. The pop will begin to fizz as carbon dioxide gas comes out of solution and forms bubbles.</p> <p>The main component of volcanic gas emissions is water vapour, followed by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), and hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S).</p> <p>Volcanoes release gases when erupt, and through openings called <strong>fumaroles </strong>(Figure 11.7). They can also release gas into soil and groundwater.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_709" style="width: 720px"><a href="#chapter-11-2-materials-produced-by-volcanic-eruptions" rel="attachment wp-att-709"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/06/fumarole_USGS.jpeg" alt="A fumarole at Puʻu ʻŌʻō Crater.

The more silica, the more&nbsp;<strong>polymerization&nbsp;</strong>(formation of long molecules) occurs, stiffening the lava. The stiffness of lava is described in terms of <strong>viscosity</strong>– lava that flows easily has low viscosity, and lava that is sticky and stiff has high viscosity.</p> <p>In general, high-silica lava contains more gas than low-silica lava. When the gas forms into bubbles, viscosity increases further. Consider the pop analogy again. If you were to shake the bottle vigorously and then open it, the pop would come gushing out in a thick, frothy flow. In contrast, if you took care to not shake the bottle before opening it, you could pour out a thin stream of fluid.</p> <h2>Chemical Composition Affects the Thickness and Shape of Lava Flows</h2> <p>The thickness and shape of a lava flow depends on its viscosity. The greater the viscosity, the thicker the flow, and the shorter the distance it travels before solidifying. Highly viscous lava might not flow very far at all, and simply accumulate as a bulge, called a <strong>lava dome</strong>, in a volcano’s crater. Figure 11.8 shows a dome formed from rhyolitic lava in the crater of Mt. St. Helens.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_715" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/06/StHelens_lava_dome_feuerborn.jpeg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/06/StHelens_lava_dome_feuerborn.jpeg" alt="Lava dome in the crater of Mt.

Figure 11.10 (bottom) shows the interior of a lava tube, with a person for scale. Lava tubes form naturally and readily because flowing mafic lava preferentially cools near its margins, forming solid <strong>lava levées</strong> that eventually close over the top of the flow.

Basaltic lava with an unfragmented surface, like that in Figure 11.9 (right), is called <strong>pahoehoe</strong>. (pronounced pa-hoy-hoy). Pahoehoe can be smooth and billowy. It can also develop a wrinkled texture, called <strong>ropy lava</strong>, as shown in Figure 11.11. Ropy lava forms when the outermost layer of the lava cools and develops a skin (visible as a dark layer in Figure 11.11, left), but the skin is still hot and thin enough to be flexible. The skin is stiffer than the lava beneath it, and is dragged by flowing lava and folded up into wrinkles. Figure 11.11 (right) is a close-up view after a cut has been made to show the internal structure of a wrinkled lava flow. Notice the many holes, or <strong>vesicles</strong>, within the lava, formed when the lava solidified around gas bubbles.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_722" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/06/ropy_lava.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/06/ropy_lava.png" alt="Ropy lava (pahoehoe) from Hawaii.

The result is a sharp and splintery rubble-like lava flow called <strong>a’a </strong>(pronounced like “lava” but without the l and v).

This is visible in the toe of the andesitic lava flow from Figure 11.9 (right). The difference between a’a and the andesitic blocky lava is that the blocky lava has fragments with smoother surfaces and fewer vesicles.</p> <h3>Lava Pillows</h3> <p>When lava flows into water, the outside of the lava cools quickly, making a tube (Figure 11.13 (top left)). Blobs of lava develop at the end of the tube (Figure 11.13 (top right)), forming <strong>pillows</strong>. The bottom left of Figure 10.13 shows pillows covering the sea floor, and the bottom right shows the distinctive rounded shape of pillows in outcrop. Because pillows always form underwater, finding them in the rock record gives us information that the environment was underwater.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_720" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/06/Pillow_lavas.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/06/Pillow_lavas.png" alt="Pillow lavas.

In the same way that shaking a pop bottle to make more bubbles will cause pop to gush out when the bottle is opened, gas bubbles can violently propel lava and other materials from a volcano, creating an explosive eruption.</p> <p>Collectively, loose material thrown from a volcano is referred to as <strong>tephra</strong>. Individual fragments are referred to in general terms as <strong>pyroclasts</strong>, so sometimes tephra is also referred to as <strong>pyroclastic debris</strong>. Pyroclasts are classified according to size.</p> <h2>Volcanic Ash</h2> <p>Particles less than 2 mm in diameter are called <strong>volcanic ash</strong>. Volcanic ash consists of small mineral grains and glass. Figure 11.16 shows volcanic ash on three scales: in the upper left is ash from the 2010 eruption of&nbsp;Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland. The image was taken with a scanning electron microscope at approximately 1000 times magnification. In the upper right is ash from the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens, collected in Yakima, Washington, about 137 km northeast of Mt. St. Helens. Individual particles are under 1 mm in size. Figure 11.16 (bottom) shows a village near Mt.

Individual volcanoes vary in the volcanic materials they produce, and this affects the size, shape, and structure of the volcano.</p> <p>There are three types of volcanoes: <strong>cinder cones</strong> (also called <strong>spatter cones</strong>), <strong>composite volcanoes</strong> (also called <strong>stratovolcanoes</strong>), and <strong>shield volcanoes</strong>. Figure 11.22 illustrates the size and shape differences amongst these volcanoes.</p> <p>Shield volcanoes, which get their name from their broad rounded shape, are the largest. Figure 11.22 shows the largest of all shield volcanoes- in fact, the largest of all volcanoes on Earth- Mauna Loa, which makes up a substantial part of the Island of Hawai‘i and has a diameter of nearly 200 km. The summit of Mauna Loa is presently 4,169 m above sea level, but this represents only a small part of the volcano. It rises up from the ocean floor at a depth of approximately 5,000 m. Furthermore, the great mass of the volcano has caused it to sag downward into the mantle by an additional 8,000 m.

Kīlauea Volcano rises only 18 m about the surrounding terrain, and is almost not visible in the scale of the diagram, however it still stretches over a distance of 125 km along the eastern side of the Island of Hawai‘i.</p> <p>Composite volcanoes are the next largest. Mt. St. Helens is shown on the left of Figure 11.22. It rises 1,356 m above the surrounding terrain in the Cascade Range of the western United States, and has a diameter of approximately 6 km. Composite volcanoes tend to be no more than 10 km in diameter. Unlike shield volcanoes, composite volcanoes have a distinctly conical shape, with sides that steepen toward the summit.</p> <p>Cinder cones are the smallest, and almost too small to see next to a volcano like Mauna Loa. Eve Cone is a cinder cone on the flanks of Mt. Edziza in northwestern British Columbia. It rises 172 m above the landscape, and has a diameter of under 500 m. Cinder cones have straight sides, unlike upward-steepening composite volcanoes, or rounded shield volcanoes.</p> <h1>Volcano Structure</h1> <h2>Shield Volcanoes</h2> <p>Shield volcanoes, like the Sierra Negra volcano in the Galápagos Islands (Figure 11.23, top), get their gentle hill-like shape because they are built of successive flows of low-viscosity basaltic lava (Figure 11.23, bottom). The low viscosity of the lava means that it can flow for long distances, resulting in the greater size of shield volcanoes compared to composite volcanoes or cinder cones.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1030" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/shield_volcano_nolabels.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/shield_volcano_nolabels.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1030" width="720" height="411" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/shield_volcano_nolabels.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/shield_volcano_nolabels-300x171.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/shield_volcano_nolabels-65x37.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/shield_volcano_nolabels-225x128.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/shield_volcano_nolabels-350x200.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 11.23</strong> Shield volcano.

The layers (strata) is where the alternative name, stratovolcano comes from. Cotopaxi displays the characteristic shape of composite volcanoes, which have slopes that get steeper near the top of the volcano. The change in the slope reflects the accumulation of tephra fragments near the volcano&#8217;s vent. Composite volcanoes typically erupt higher viscosity andesitic and rhyolitic lavas, which do not travel as far from the vent as basaltic lavas do. This results in volcanoes of smaller diameter than shield volcanoes. A notable exception is Mt. Fuji in Japan, which erupts basaltic lava.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_834" style="width: 1008px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=834"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/stratovolcano_Cotopaxi.png" alt="Composite volcano.

If volcanic activity ceases, it might erode away within a few tens of thousands of years. This is largely because of the presence of pyroclastic eruptive material, which is not strong.</p> <h2>Cinder Cones (Spatter Cones)</h2> <p>Cinder cones, like Mt. Capulin in Figure 11.25, have straight sides and are typically less than 200 m high. Most are made up of fragments of scoria (vesicular rock from basaltic lava) that were expelled from the volcano as gas-rich magma erupted. Because cinder cones are made up almost exclusively of loose fragments, they have very little strength. They can be eroded away easily, and relatively quickly.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_837" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=837"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/08/cinder_cone_Capulin.png" alt="Cinder cone.

The characteristics of the eruptions themselves also vary from one volcano to the next, and sometimes from one eruption to the next for the same volcano. Eruptions are classified according how explosive they are, and the height of their <strong>eruption column</strong>&#8211; how high they blast material into the air.</p> <p>Both the explosiveness of an eruption and the height of the eruption column are related in part to the composition of magma and the amount of gas it contains. In particular, magmas with more silica erupt more explosively. The higher the silica content, the greater the viscosity of the magma. This means more pressure can build up before the magma is forced out of the volcano. Magma with more silica also tends to contain more dissolved gas. The gas helps to propel magma out of the volcano, in the same way that the bubbles in a shaken bottle of pop cause the pop to foam out when the lid is removed.</p> <p>There are four types of eruptions with properties determined mostly by the silica content of magma, and the amount of gas it contains. In order of increasing explosiveness, these are <strong>Hawai&#8217;ian</strong>, <strong>Strombolian</strong>, <strong>Vulcanian</strong>, and <strong>Plinian</strong> eruptions. Any composition of magma can have an explosive eruption if the magma suddenly encounters water. Hot magma contacting groundwater or seawater causes the water to flash to steam. Explosive eruptions driven by water are called <strong>hydrovolcanic</strong> (or <strong>phreatic</strong>) eruptions.</p> <h1>Hawai‘ian Eruptions</h1> <p>Hawai‘ian eruptions are named after the characteristic eruptions of volcanoes of the Hawai‘ian islands. Hawai‘ian eruptions are <strong>effusive</strong> (flowing) rather than explosive because they erupt low-viscosity basaltic lava. Hawai‘ian eruptions form shield volcanoes and can also take the form of <strong>fissure eruptions</strong>. Fissure eruptions occur when lava erupts from long cracks in the ground rather than from a central vent.</p> <p>Figure 11.26 shows examples from two eruptions on of Hawai‘i. In the upper left and right are images from the November 1959 eruption of Kīlauea Iki Crater. The upper left shows a fissure eruption and effusive flow of lava. Burning trees appear as bright spots toward the bottom of the photo. Figure 11.26 (right) shows a lava fountain reaching 425 m above Kīlauea Iki Crater. U. S. Geological Survey scientists reported that volcanic bombs up to 60 cm across smashed the guard rail and dented the asphalt on the road. Figure 11.26 (lower left) shows Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO) scientists making a quick getaway, with lava fountains from Mauna Loa Volcano in the background.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_936" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Hawaiian_eruption.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Hawaiian_eruption.png" alt="Hawaiian eruptions.

Stromboli in Italy, occur when basaltic lava has higher viscosity and higher gas content. The sticky lava is ejected in loud, violent, but short-lived spattery eruptions. Clumps of gas-rich lava thrown 10s to 100s of metres in the air accumulate as scoria in a pile around the vent, forming cinder cones. Figure 11.27 shows a strombolian eruption in the crater of Mt. Etna. A smaller cinder cone is forming around the vent as lava sputters out of it.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_940" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=940"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Strombolian_Etna.png" alt="Strombolian eruption of Mt.

In Roman mythology, Vulcan was the maker of armour and weaponry for the gods, and volcanic eruptions were attributed to him working in his forge.</p> <p>Vulcanian eruptions are far more explosive than Strombolian eruptions, and can blast tephra and gas to a height of 5 to 10 km. The explosiveness is related to a build-up of pressure as the higher viscosity of intermediate silica content lava restricts the escape of gas. Vulcanian eruptions produce large quantities of ash in addition to blocks and bombs.</p> <p>The Vulcanian eruption of Mt. Pelée on the island of Martinique in 1902 resulted in the first detailed documentation by geologists of a devastating phenomenon that is now referred to as a <strong>pyroclastic flow</strong> (Figure 11.28). Volcanic debris from the collapse of a lava dome on Mt. Pelée combined with hot gas to form a searing avalanche that raced down the mountain, over the city of St. Pierre, and into the harbour.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_946" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=946"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Lacroix_1902_Pelee.png" alt="A series of photos taken by Alfred Lacroix during the eruption of Mt.

The following first-hand account was published in <em>Cosmopolitan Magazine</em> in July of 1902, attributed to Ellery S. Scott, a sailor on the steamship <em>Roraima</em>:</p> <div><em>&#8220;In idle interest, I turned my glass toward Mont Pelee. It was at that very moment that the whole top of the mountain seemed blown into the air. The sound that fol­lowed was deafening. A great mass of flames, seemingly a mile in diameter, with twisting giant wreaths of smoke, rolled thousands of feet into the air, and then overbalanced and came rolling down the seamed and cracked sides of the mountain.  Foot hills were overflowed by the onrush­ing mass. It was not mere flame and smoke. It was molten lava, giant blocks of stone and a hail of smaller stones, with a mass of scalding mud intermingled.</em></div> <div></div> <div><em>For one brief moment I saw the city of St. Pierre before me. Then it was blotted out by the overwhelming flood. There was no time for the people to flee. They had not even time to pray&#8230;. I had called to Carpenter Benson to start the windlass, but before he could move, the &#8220;Roraima&#8221; rolled almost on her port beam-ends, and then as suddenly went to starboard. The funnel, masts and boats went by the board in an instant. The decks were swept clean. The hatches were staved in. The next instant a hail of fire and red-hot stones was upon the ship. Then came the scalding mud. The saloon was ablaze. The ship seemed doomed. Men were struck down all around me by flaming masses of lava. From bright sun­light the air became dense as midnight. The smoke that rolled down from the cra­ter&#8217;s mouth had blotted the sun from our vision.&#8221;</em></div> <div></div> <div>Scott&#8217;s account vividly describes of the speed of the pyroclastic flow. In some cases, pyroclastic flows travel at speeds greater than 700 km/h. They are able to travel rapidly because they behave like a fluid, and can also ride on a cushion of hot gas. Scott says the city was &#8220;blotted out by a flood,&#8221; yet the lower parts of buildings remained (Figure 11.29), and human remains were found in streets and homes where they had fallen. The ruins of St. Pierre look as though the top of the city were shaved off, and that is effectively what happened as the pyroclastic flow rushed across it, buoyed by gas.</div> <div></div> <div><div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_952" style="width: 700px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/StPierre_stereoview.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/StPierre_stereoview.png" alt="Two stereographs of the ruins of St. Pierre, published in 1902.

The origin of the name is the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE, which buried the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The Roman admiral Gaius Plinius Secundus, also known as Pliny the Elder, attempted a rescue mission when he saw the column of ash and debris above Vesuvius, but died of unknown causes without being able to reach Herculaneum.</p> <p>A more recent Plinian eruption was that of Mt. Redoubt on April 21, 1990, shown in Figure 11.30. Pyroclastic flows resulted, as did <strong>lahars</strong>, landslides that formed when glaciers melted and turned volcanic ash into mud. The shape of the eruptive column, with parts of the column appearing to spread out in flat layers at different levels, reflects differences in atmospheric characteristics.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_957" style="width: 800px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=957"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Redoubt_1990.png" alt="Plinian eruption of Mt.

They occur when water in the form of groundwater, seawater, or even melting glacial ice or snow comes into contact with magma. Heat from the magma changes water suddenly to steam, which can expand to more than a thousand times the original volume of water. The sudden expansion results in an explosive force that can blast a volcano to pieces and create large amounts of volcanic ash.</p> <p>In April of 2010, activity by the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull (Figure 11.31) melted the glacier above it, releasing large quantities of water and triggering a hydrovolcanic eruption. Ash rose in a plume 10 km high, and was blown westward and into the skies over Europe. Volcanic ash can damage or destroy aircraft engines, so the precaution was taken to prohibit air travel for a 5-day period. The enormous economic impact of stopping flights has led to numerous studies about the best way to deal with similar events with volcanic ash in the future.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_963" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=963"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Eyjafjallajokull_hydrovolcanic.png" alt="Figure 11-31 Hydrovolcanic eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in April of 2010.

At roughly 60 km below the surface, the mantle rocks have decompressed is enough to permit partial melting of approximately 10% of the ultramafic rock. Mafic magma is produced, and it moves up toward the surface. Magma fills vertical fractures produced by the spreading and spills out onto the sea floor making pillow lavas and lava flows. Spreading-ridge volcanism is taking place approximately 200 km offshore from the west coast of Vancouver Island.</p> <p>In continental rift zones where continental crust is thinning (far right in Figure 11.32), a similar decompression process occurs, triggering partial melting of ultramafic mantle rocks. However, if the continental crust above the region where melting occurs has a lower melting temperature than the mafic melt that is produced, the continental crust will also melt.</p> <p>Continental rift zones can have a range of volcano types. If mafic magma erupts, shield volcanoes, broad lava flows, and cinder cones result. However, if rocks of other compositions are melted and added in, or the mafic magma undergoes fractional crystallization before erupting, then composite volcanoes will also form.</p> <h1>Water Causes Partial Melting Along Subduction Zones</h1> <p>At an ocean-continent convergent boundary (Figure 11.32, right) or ocean-ocean convergent boundary (Figure 11.32, left), oceanic crust is pushed down into the mantle. Although temperatures are high, the slab is kept from melting by high pressures. However, under these conditions minerals in the slab release water from within their crystal structures. The water lowers the melting point of rock above the slab, and partial melting is triggered within the mantle. Mafic magma rises through the mantle to the base of the crust. There it contributes to partial melting of crustal rock, and more felsic material is added to the magma. The magma, now intermediate in composition, continues to rise and assimilate crustal material. In the upper part of the crust, it accumulates into plutons. Over time, fractional crystallization of magma within the pluton can make it even more silica-rich. From time to time, the magma from the plutons rises toward surface, leading to volcanic eruptions. <strong><br /> </strong></p> <p>Composite volcanoes with Vulcanian or Plinian eruption styles are characteristic of the volcanic arcs that form in subduction zones, although in the Trans-Mexico Volcanic Belt, Strombolian eruptions produce short-lived cinder cones. Where two margins of oceanic crust collide, the volcanic arc will be a chain of volcanic islands. Where continental and oceanic crust collide, there will be a volcanic arc on the continental crust.</p> <div class="textbox"><h4>Mt.

St. Helens&#8217; eruptions have been of felsic or intermediate material. The lava tube in Figure 11.10 (bottom) is from a time when Mt. St. Helens erupted basaltic lava. Data from the iMUSH (Imaging Magma Under St. Helens) project show that a magma chamber is present beneath Mt. St. Helens at between 5 and 14 km depth, but that a much larger magma chamber is present below it, which extends down to the mantle (Figure 11.34). Earthquakes in the 24 hours after the 1980 eruption suggested movement of magma within the smaller chamber (yellow arrows in Figure 11.34), but earthquakes from 1980 to 2005 indicate movement of magma within the deeper chamber as well (black arrows).</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_984" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Kiser_et_al_iMUSH.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Kiser_et_al_iMUSH.png" alt="Magma chambers beneath Mt.

St. Helens could reflect changes in the composition of magma within the small chamber over time, as fractionation proceeds, and the magma becomes more silica rich. However, movement of more mafic magma from the larger chamber could also contribute to eruptions with different chemical compositions. The larger magma chamber may be connected to a chamber feeding the nearby Indian Heaven Volcanic Field, which contains shield volcanoes and cinder cones, and for which basalt makes up 80% of erupted materials.</p> </div> <h1>Mantle Plumes Can Cause Volcanism Away from Plate Boundaries</h1> <p><strong>Mantle plumes </strong>are rising columns of hot solid rock. The column may be kilometres to 10s of kilometres across, but near the surface it spreads out to create a mushroom-like head that is 10s to over 100 kilometres across. Mantle plumes are different from the convection that normally occurs beneath ocean spreading centres: plumes rise approximately 10 times faster than mantle convection normally occurs, and may originate deep in the mantle, possibly just above the core-mantle boundary.</p> <p>When the mantle plume rises to the base of the lithosphere, the pressure is low enough to permit partial melting of the plume material, producing mafic magma. Heat carried by the mantle plume may also melt rock adjacent to the plume. The magma rises and feeds <strong>hotspot volcanoes</strong>. The lithospheric plate above the mantle plume is moving across the plume, so a chain of hotspot volcanoes can result as existing hotspot volcanoes are slowly moved away from the mantle plume, and new volcanoes form in the lithosphere.</p> <p>Many shield volcanoes are associated with mantle plumes, including those that make up the Hawai&#8217;ian islands. All of the Hawai&#8217;ian volcanoes are related to the mantle plume that currently lies beneath Mauna Loa, Kilauea, and <span class="st">Lōʻihi </span>(Figure 11.35, top). There is evidence of crustal magma chambers beneath all three active Hawai&#8217;ian volcanoes. At Kīlauea, the magma chamber appears to be several kilometres in diameter, and is situated between 8 km and 11 km below surface (Lin et al., 2014). In this area, the Pacific Plate is moving northwest at a rate of about 7 cm/year. This means that the earlier formed — and now extinct — volcanoes have now moved well away from the mantle plume. The hotspot has in fact been present for at least 85 million years (Regelous et al., 2003), as evidenced by the long chain of eroded and submerged mountains stretching to the Aleutian Trench (Figure 11.35, bottom).</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_989" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Hawaiian_hotspot.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Hawaiian_hotspot.png" alt="Hawai’ian hotspot volcanoes and volcanic chain.

If volcanism continues above the Hawaii mantle plume in the same manner that it has for the past 85 Ma, it is likely that Kīlauea Volcano will continue to erupt for at least another 500,000 years. By that time, its neighbour, <span class="st">Lōʻihi Seamount</span>, will have emerged from the sea floor, and its other neighbours, Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, will have become significantly eroded, like their cousins, the islands to the northwest.</p> <h2>Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs)</h2> <p>While the Hawaii mantle plume has produced a relatively low volume of magma for approximately 85 Ma, other mantle plumes are less consistent, and some generate massive volumes of magma over relatively short time periods. Although their origin is still controversial, it is thought that the volcanism leading to <strong>large igneous provinces</strong> (LIPs) is related to very high volume but relatively short duration bursts of magma from mantle plumes. An example of an LIP is the Columbia River Basalt Group, which extends across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in the United States (Figure 11.36). This volcanism, which covered an area of about 160,000 km<sup>2</sup> with basaltic rock up to several hundred metres thick, took place between 17 and 14 Ma.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_992" style="width: 768px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/CRBG_LIP.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/CRBG_LIP.png" alt="Part of the Columbia River Basalt Group at Frenchman Coulee, eastern Washington, United States.

Over the past 2 Ma, three very large explosive eruptions at Yellowstone have yielded approximately 900 km<sup>3</sup> of felsic magma. This is approximately 900 times the volume of the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens, but only 5% of the volume of mafic magma in the Columbia River LIP.</p> <p>Most other LIP eruptions are much bigger. The Siberian Traps (also basalt), which erupted at the end of the Permian period at 251 Ma, are estimated to have produced approximately 40 times as much lava as the Columbia River LIP. The largest known LIP is the Ontong Java Plateau, located in the southwest Pacific Ocean. It formed at around 122 Ma, and presently covers 1,500,000 km<span style="font-size: 75%;vertical-align: super">2</span> and has a volume of 5,000,000 km<sup>3</sup>. But this is only a small fraction of its original size. The majority of it has been subducted, and it may have been split into pieces that have been classified as separate LIPs.</p> <h2>Kimberlites</h2> <p><strong>Kimberlite</strong> pipes are carrot-shaped cones of ultramafic rock. They form from the explosive eruption of mantle plumes originating at depths of 150 to 450 km in the mantle. The plume makes its way to the surface quickly (over hours to days), having little interaction with the surrounding rocks, and thus preserving a sample of the ultramafic mantle. As the plume nears the surface, a build-up of gas causes it to pick up speed, and by the time it reaches the surface it may be travelling faster than the speed of sound. The explosiveness of kimberlite eruptions means that they do not form volcanic mountains on the surface, but leave circular holes in the ground.</p> <p>Kimberlite eruptions that originate at depths greater than 200 km beneath old, thick, continental crust travel through the region of the mantle where diamond is stable. In some cases, such as in Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories, kimberlites bring diamond-bearing material to the surface. All of Earth&#8217;s diamond deposits are thought to have originated in this way.</p> <p>Diamond mines in kimberlites, such as the Ekati Mine in the Northwest Territories, are easy to spot by the characteristic circular hole that develops as miners excavate the cone-shaped structure (Figure 11.37). The kimberlites at Ekati erupted between 45 and 60 Ma. Many kimberlites are older, and some much older. There have been no kimberlite eruptions in historic times. The youngest known kimberlites are in the Igwisi Hills in Tanzania and are only about 10,000 years old. The next youngest date to approximately 30 Ma.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_994" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=994"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Ekati_mine.png" alt="" class="wp-image-994 size-full" width="720" height="492" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Ekati_mine.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Ekati_mine-300x205.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Ekati_mine-65x44.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Ekati_mine-225x154.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Ekati_mine-350x239.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 11.37</strong> The Ekati diamond mine in the Northwest Territories, part of the Lac de Gras kimberlite field. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2017) CC BY-SA 4.0; Photograph by J.

Even the relatively free-flowing Hawai&#8217;ian basaltic lava moves slowly enough that it can be escaped on foot. Far more dangerous hazards are related to gases and volcanic debris. However, the largest impact and the greatest suffering are caused not by the immediate effects of volcanic eruptions, but by large-scale changes to climate and environments caused by volcanism. Indirect effects resulting in respiratory distress, toxicity, famine, and habitat destruction have accounted for approximately 8 million deaths during historical times, while direct effects have accounted for fewer than 200,000, or 2.5% of the total.</p> <h1>Volcanic Gas and Tephra Emissions</h1> <p>Large volumes of rock and gases are emitted during major Plinian eruptions at composite volcanoes, and a large volume of gas is released during some very high-volume effusive eruptions. Gases and fine particles of volcanic ash can cause respiratory distress and poisoning, and ash poses a risk for aircraft.</p> <p>Most of the tephra from large explosive eruptions ascends high into the atmosphere, and some of it is distributed around Earth by high-altitude winds. The larger components (larger than 0.1 mm) fall closer to the volcano, and the accumulation of tephra from large eruptions can cause serious damage and casualties. When the large eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines occurred in 1991, tens of centimetres of ash accumulated in fields and on rooftops in the surrounding populated region. Heavy typhoon rains hit the island at the same time and added to the weight of the tephra. The weight was too much for roofs to bear, and thousands of structures collapsed, causing at least 300 of the 700 deaths attributed to the eruption.</p> <p>One of the long-term effects of adding volcanic particles and gases to the atmosphere is cooling. Over an eight-month period in 1783 and 1784, a massive effusive eruption took place at the Laki volcano in Iceland. Although there was relatively little volcanic ash involved, a massive amount of sulphur dioxide was released into the atmosphere, along with a significant volume of hydrofluoric acid (HF). The sulphur dioxide combined with water to make sulphate <strong>aerosols</strong>, which block incoming solar energy. The accumulation of sulphate aerosols over that 8 months led to dramatic cooling in the northern hemisphere. There were serious crop failures in Europe and North America, and a total of 6 million people are estimated to have died from famine and respiratory complications. In Iceland, poisoning from the HF resulted in the death of 80% of sheep, and 50% of cattle. The ensuing famine, along with HF poisoning, resulted in more than 10,000 human deaths, about 25% of the population.</p> <h1>Pyroclastic Flows</h1> <p>In a typical explosive eruption at a composite volcano, the tephra and gases are ejected with explosive force and sent high up into the atmosphere. As the eruption proceeds, and the amount of gas in the rising magma starts to decrease, and less gas is supplied to the eruption column. Parts of the column will become denser than air, leading the column to collapse and flow downward along the flanks of the volcano (Figure 11.39), picking up speed as it cools.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_378" style="width: 800px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/eruption-of-Mt.-Mayon.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/eruption-of-Mt.-Mayon.jpg" alt="The Plinian eruption of Mt.

Most are caused by melting snow and ice during an eruption, as was the case with the lahar that destroyed the Colombian town of Armero in 1985 when the volcano Nevado del Ruiz caused the ice dam on a glacial lake to fail.

In October 1998, category 5 hurricane Mitch slammed into the coast of Central America. Damage was extensive and 19,000 people died. Fatalities were largely because of mudflows and debris flows triggered by intense rainfall — some regions received almost 2 m of rain over a few days.</p> <p>At Casita Volcano in Nicaragua, the heavy rains weakened rock and volcanic debris on the upper slopes, resulting in a debris flow that rapidly built in volume as it raced down the steep slope. It struck the towns of El Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez killing more than 2,000 people. El Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez were new towns that had been built without planning approval in an area that was known to be at risk of lahars.</p> <h1>Sector Collapse and Debris Avalanche</h1> <p>In the context of volcanoes, <strong>sector collapse</strong> or <strong>flank collapse</strong> is the catastrophic failure of a significant part of an existing volcano, creating a large debris avalanche. This hazard was first recognized with the failure of the north side of Mt. St. Helens immediately prior to the large eruption on May 18, 1980.</p> <p>In the weeks before the eruption, a large bulge had formed on the side of the volcano (Figure 11.41) as magma moved from depth into a magma chamber within the mountain itself. Early on the morning of May 18, a moderate earthquake struck and destabilized the bulge, leading to Earth’s largest observed landslide in historical times. The failure of this part of the volcano exposed the underlying magma chamber, causing it to explode sideways. This in turn exposed the conduit leading to the magma chamber below, resulting in a Plinian eruption lasting nine hours.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1019" style="width: 800px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/800px-MSH80_bulge_on_north_side_04-27-80.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/800px-MSH80_bulge_on_north_side_04-27-80.jpg" alt="Bulge forming on the north side of Mt.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-11-7-monitoring-volcanoes-and-predicting-eruptions" title="11.7 Monitoring Volcanoes and Predicting Eruptions"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">78</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">11.7 Monitoring Volcanoes and Predicting Eruptions</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>In 2005 U. S. Geological Survey geologist Chris Newhall made a list of the six most important signs of an imminent volcanic eruption. They are:</p> <ol><li><em>Gas leaks</em> — the release of gases (mostly H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>) from the magma into the atmosphere through cracks in the overlying rock</li> <li><em>Bulging</em> — the deformation of part of the volcano, indicating that a magma chamber at depth is swelling or becoming more pressurized</li> <li><em>Seismicity</em> — many (hundreds to thousands) of small earthquakes, indicating that magma is on the move. The quakes may be the result of the magma forcing the surrounding rocks to crack, or a harmonic vibration that is evidence of magmatic fluids moving underground.</li> <li><em>Seismicity ceases</em> — a sudden decrease in the rate of earthquake activity. This may indicate that magma has stalled, and that\ something is about to give way</li> <li><em>Big bump</em> — a pronounced bulge on the side of the volcano (like the one at Mt. St. Helens in 1980), which may indicate that magma has moved close to surface</li> <li><em>Steam</em> — steam eruptions ( <strong>phreatic</strong> <strong>eruptions</strong>) that happen when magma near the surface heats groundwater to the boiling point. The water eventually explodes, sending fragments of the overlying rock far into the air.</li> </ol> <p>With these signs in mind, it is possible to determine the necessary equipment to have and actions to take to monitor a volcano and predict when it might erupt. we can make a list of the equipment we should have and the actions we can take to monitor a volcano and predict when it might erupt.</p> <h1>Assessing Seismicity</h1> <p>The simplest and cheapest way to monitor a volcano is with <strong>seismometers</strong>, instruments that detect vibration. In an area with several volcanoes that have the potential to erupt (e.g., the Squamish-Pemberton area), a few well-placed seismometers can provide an early warning that something is changing beneath one of the volcanoes.

It’s important to be able to monitor changes in the composition of volcanic gases, and we need instruments to do that. Some can be monitored from a distance (from the ground or even from the air) using infrared devices, but to obtain more accurate data, we need to sample the air and do chemical analysis. This can be achieved with instruments placed on the ground close to the source of the gases, or by collecting samples (Figure 11.43) and analyzing them in a lab.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1023" style="width: 535px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/USGS_Gas-sampling_img1092.jpeg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/USGS_Gas-sampling_img1092.jpeg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1023" width="535" height="400" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/USGS_Gas-sampling_img1092.jpeg 535w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/USGS_Gas-sampling_img1092-300x224.jpeg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/USGS_Gas-sampling_img1092-65x49.jpeg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/USGS_Gas-sampling_img1092-225x168.jpeg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/USGS_Gas-sampling_img1092-350x262.jpeg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 11.43</strong> A geologist collects a gas sample from Sherman Crater, Mt.

One is known as a <strong>tiltmeter</strong>, which is a sensitive three-directional level that can sense small changes in the tilt of the ground at a specific location. Another is through the use of GPS (global positioning system) technology (Figure 11.27). GPS is more effective than a tiltmeter because it provides information on how far the ground has actually moved — east-west, north-south, and up-down.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_384" style="width: 569px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Hualalai-volcano.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Hualalai-volcano.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-384" width="569" height="474" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Hualalai-volcano.jpg 569w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Hualalai-volcano-300x250.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Hualalai-volcano-65x54.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Hualalai-volcano-225x187.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Hualalai-volcano-350x292.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 11.44</strong> A GPS unit installed at Hualālai Volcano, Hawaii.

They can then make recommendations to authorities about the need for evacuations and restricting transportation corridors.</p> <p>Our ability to predict volcanic eruptions has increased dramatically in recent decades because of advances in our understanding of how volcanoes behave and in monitoring technology. Providing that careful work is done, there is no longer a large risk of surprise eruptions, and providing that public warnings are issued and heeded, it is less and less likely that thousands will die from sector collapse, pyroclastic flows, ash falls, or lahars. Indirect hazards are still very real, however, and we can expect the next eruption like the one at Laki in 1783 to take an even greater toll than it did then, especially since there are now roughly eight times as many people on Earth.</p> </div></div>

They were fed by lava that seeped up along a leaky transform fault.</p> <p>Southwestern British Columbia is at the northern end of the Juan de Fuca subduction zone, and part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that extends south through Washington and Oregon. The Canadian part of the Cascade Arc has had a lower rate and volume of volcanism than U. S. portions. One reason is that the northern part of the Juan de Fuca Plate is subducting more slowly than the rest of the plate, or else has stalled.</p> <p>The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt has several <strong>volcanic centres </strong>, or regions where volcanism has caused multiple volcanoes to develop (Figure 11.46).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1039" style="width: 576px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt-large.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt-en.svg_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1039 size-full" height="445" width="576" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt-en.svg_.png 576w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt-en.svg_-300x232.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt-en.svg_-65x50.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt-en.svg_-225x174.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/09/Garibaldi_Volcanic_Belt-en.svg_-350x270.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 11.46</strong> Volcanic centres within the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt.

Some volcanoes are cone-shaped or hill-shaped mountains, and some eruptions happen along fissures. Eruptions are fed by a magma chamber beneath the volcano. Sometimes a volcano collapses into empty space in the magma chamber beneath, forming a caldera.</p> <h3>11.2 Materials Produced by Volcanic Eruptions</h3> <p>Volcanoes produce gas, lava flows, and debris called tephra. The characteristics of a lava flows depend on whether the lava is thin and runny (mafic with low gas content) or thick and sticky (felsic with high gas content). Tephra is classified according to size. Ash is less than 2 mm in diameter, lapilli is between 2 mm and 64 mm, and blocks and bombs are larger than 64 mm.</p> <h3>11.3 Types of Volcanoes</h3> <p>Cinder cones are relatively small straight-sided volcanoes that are composed mostly of mafic rock fragments. Composite volcanoes consist of alternating layers of lava flows and tephra. The tend to be intermediate to felsic in composition, and get steeper toward the top. Shield volcanoes are broad, low, hill-like volcanoes that form from layers of low-viscosity mafic lava.</p> <h3>11.4 Types of Volcanic Eruptions</h3> <p>Volcanic eruptions can be classified according to how explosive they are, and how high into the atmosphere they blast material. Hawai&#8217;ian eruptions are relatively gentle effusive eruptions of low-viscosity mafic lava, and form shield volcanoes. Strombolian eruptions are more vigorous eruptions of mafic tephra. They blast material hundreds of metres into the air. The tephra falls out of the atmosphere to form a cinder cone. Vulcanian eruptions are explosive eruptions of intermediate composition lava, producing pyroclastic flows and eruptive columns from 5 to 10 km high. Plinian eruptions are highly explosive eruptions of felsic lava, and can produce eruption columns up to 45 km high. Both Vulcanian and Plinian eruptions are associated with composite volcanoes. Hydrovolcanic eruptions are the explosive result of magma or lava interacting with water, and rapidly changing the water to steam.</p> <h3>11.5 Plate Tectonics and Volcanism</h3> <p>Volcanism is closely related to plate tectonics. Most volcanoes are associated with convergent plate boundaries (at subduction zones), but a great deal of volcanic activity also occurs at divergent boundaries and areas of continental rifting. At convergent boundaries magma is formed where water from a subducting plate acts as a flux to lower the melting temperature of the adjacent mantle rock. At divergent boundaries magma forms because of decompression melting. Decompression melting also takes place within a mantle plume.</p> <h3>11.6 Volcanic Hazards</h3> <p>Most direct volcanic hazards are related to volcanoes that erupt explosively, especially composite volcanoes. Pyroclastic flows, some as hot as 1000 ˚C, can move at hundreds of km/h and will kill anything in the way. Lahars, volcano-related mudflows, can be large enough to destroy entire towns.  Lava flows are also destructive, but tend to move slowly enough to permit people to get to safety. Indirect hazards claim far more lives than direct hazards, and include famine related to volcanically-induced climate cooling.</p> <h3>11.7 Monitoring Volcanoes and Predicting Eruptions</h3> <p>Clues that a volcanic eruption might soon occur include earthquakes, a change in the type and amount of gases released, and changes in the shape of the volcano as magma moves within it. Volcanoes are monitored using seismometers to detect earthquakes, volcanic gases are sampled and analyzed, and instruments are used to detect deformation of the volcano. These tools make it possible to assess the hazard posed by a given volcano, and the risk of eruption.</p> <h3>11.8 Volcanoes in British Columbia</h3> <p>British Columbia and the Yukon Territory include examples of volcanoes that form as a result of fluid-induced melting along a subduction zone (the Wrangell and Garibaldi volcanic belts) , as a result of decompression where the crust is thinning and stretching (Stikine Volcanic Belt and Wells Gray-Clearwater Volcanic Field), and because of mantle plume activity (Anahim Volcanic Belt).</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>What are the three main tectonic settings for volcanism on Earth?</li> <li>What is the primary mechanism for partial melting at a convergent plate boundary?</li> <li>Why are the viscosity and gas content of a magma important in determining the type of volcanic rocks that will be formed when that magma is extruded?</li> <li>Why do the gases in magma not form gas bubbles when the magma is deep within the crust?</li> <li>Where and why do pillow lavas form?</li> <li>What two kinds of volcanic materials make up a composite volcano?</li> <li>What is a lahar, and why are lahars commonly associated with eruptions of composite volcanoes?</li> <li>Under what other circumstances might a lahar form?</li> <li>Why do shield volcanoes have gentle slopes?</li> <li>Which type of volcanic mountain would last longest: a shield volcano, a cinder cone, or a composite volcano?</li> <li>Why is weak seismic activity (small earthquakes) typically associated with the early stages of a volcanic eruption?</li> <li>How can GPS technology be used to help monitor a volcano for activity?</li> <li>What is the likely geological origin of the Nazko Cone?</li> <li>What might be the explanation for southwestern B.C. having much less subduction-related volcanism than adjacent Washington and Oregon?</li> </ol> </div></div>

It caused substantial damage to structures, including the school shown in Figure 12.2, and resulting in one fatality. The shaking was so violent that the seismograph measuring the earthquake in Victoria was broken a few seconds after the earthquake started. Even if the seismograph had survived, it was not sensitive enough to provide sufficiently detailed information about local earthquakes, and was unable to record some of them at all. There was only one monitoring station in British Columbia, so while it was possible to determine how far away the earthquake was from the station, geologists were not able to say in which direction. In 1955, Canadian seismologist W. G. Milne wrote that “the 1946 earthquake indicated in a very forceful manner the need for better instruments for the study of earthquakes in British Columbia.” A network of improved instruments was established as a direct result of the earthquake.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1423" style="width: 864px"><a href="#part-chapter-12-earthquakes-3rd-edition"><img class="wp-image-1423 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Vancouver_Island_nomap.png" alt="" width="864" height="310" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Vancouver_Island_nomap.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Vancouver_Island_nomap-300x108.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Vancouver_Island_nomap-768x276.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Vancouver_Island_nomap-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Vancouver_Island_nomap-225x81.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Vancouver_Island_nomap-350x126.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.2</strong> Damage to an elementary school in Courtenay, British Columbia after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake on Sunday, June 23, 1946.

Recording earthquakes and determining their location of origin is important for establishing what geological conditions are responsible for the earthquakes, and understanding the risk they pose. After new, more sensitive instruments were installed at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, geologists quickly learned that they had underestimated earthquake activity in the area. Between June of 1948 and August of 1951, 224 local earthquakes were recorded!</p> <p>By studying earthquakes, geoscientists and engineers are making progress toward learning how to minimize earthquake damage, and how to reduce the number of people affected by earthquakes.&nbsp; This knowledge can be communicated to governments, so they are aware of what is needed to keep the population safe. It can also be communicated to individuals, so they know what to expect and do in the event of an earthquake, and can be adequately prepared with emergency supplies.</p> <h4>Additional Resources</h4> <div>Lamontagne, M., Halchuk, S., Cassidy, J.

Although motion along a fault is part of what happens when an earthquake occurs, rocks grinding past each other is not what creates the shaking. In fact, it could be said that the earthquake happens <em>after </em>rocks have undergone most of the displacement. Consider this: if rocks slide a few centimetres or even metres along a fault, would that motion <em>alone</em> explain the incredible damage caused by some earthquakes? If you were in a car that suddenly accelerated then stopped, you would feel a jolt. But earthquakes are not a single jolt. Buildings can swing back and forth until they shake themselves to pieces, train tracks can buckle and twist into s-shapes, and roads can roll up and down like waves on the ocean. During an earthquake, rock is not only slipping. It is also vibrating like a plucked guitar string.</p> <p>Rocks might seem rigid, but when stress is applied they may stretch. If there hasn’t been too much stretching, a rock will snap back to its original shape once the stress is removed. Deformation that is reversible is called <strong>elastic deformation</strong>. Rocks that are stressed beyond their ability to stretch can rupture, allowing the rest of the rock to snap back to its original shape. The snapping back of the rock returning to its original shape causes the rock to vibrate, and this is what causes the shaking during an earthquake. The snapping back is called <strong>elastic rebound</strong>.</p> <p>Figure 12.3 (top) shows this sequence of events. Stress is applied to a rock and deforms it. The deformed rock ruptures, forming a fault. After rupturing, the rock above and below the fault snaps back to the shape it had before deformation.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1189" style="width: 758px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound-1024x770.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1189" width="758" height="570" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound-1024x770.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound-300x226.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound-768x577.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound-65x49.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound-225x169.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound-350x263.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Elastic_rebound.png 1317w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.3</strong> Elastic deformation, rupture, and elastic rebound. Top: Stress applied to a rock causes it to deform by stretching. When the stress becomes too much for the rock, it ruptures, forming a fault. The rock snaps back to its original shape in a process called elastic rebound. Bottom: On an existing fault, asperities keep rocks on either side of the fault from sliding. Stress deforms the rock until the asperities break, releasing the stress, and causing the rocks to spring back to their original shape. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2017) CC BY 4.0.

The rocks on either side of the fault are locked together because bumps along the fault, called <strong>asperities</strong>, prevent the rocks from moving relative to each other. When the stress is great enough to break the asperities, the rocks on either side of the fault can slide again. While the rocks are locked together, stress can cause elastic deformation. When asperities break and release the stress, the rocks undergo elastic rebound and return to their original shape.</p> <h1>Rupture Surfaces Are Where the Action Happens</h1> <p>Images like 12.3 are useful for illustrating elastic deformation and rupture, but they can be misleading.&nbsp; The rupture that happens doesn’t occur as in 12.3, with the block being ruptured through and through.&nbsp; The rupture and displacement only happen along a subsection of a fault, called the <strong>rupture surface</strong>.&nbsp; In Figure 12.4, the rupture surface is the dark pink patch.&nbsp; It takes up only a part of the <strong>fault plane</strong> (lighter pink). The fault plane represents the surface where the fault exists, and where ruptures have happened in the past.&nbsp; Although the fault plane is drawn as being flat in Figure 12.4, faults are not actually perfectly flat.</p> <p>The location on the fault plane where the rupture happens is called the <strong>hypocentre</strong> or <strong>focus</strong> of the earthquake (Figure 12.4, right). The location on Earth’s surface immediately above the hypocentre is the <strong>epicentre</strong> of the earthquake.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1288" style="width: 1024px"><a href="#chapter-12-1-what-is-an-earthquake-2" rel="attachment wp-att-1288"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-1024x301.png" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1288" width="1024" height="301" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-1024x301.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-300x88.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-768x226.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-65x19.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-225x66.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Rupture_focus_epicentre-350x103.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.4</strong> Rupture surface (dark pink), on a fault plane (light pink).

In Figure 12.4, the larger arrows indicate where there has been more displacement, and the smaller arrows where there has been less.&nbsp; Beyond the edge of the rupture surface there is no displacement at all.&nbsp; Notice that this particular rupture surface doesn’t even extend to the land surface of the diagram.</p> <p>The size of a rupture surface and the amount of displacement along it will depend on a number of factors, including the type and strength of the rock, and the degree to which the rock was stressed beforehand. The magnitude of an earthquake will depend on the size of the rupture surface and the amount of displacement.</p> <p>A rupture doesn’t occur all at once along a rupture surface. It starts at a single point and spreads rapidly from there. Figure 12.4 illustrates a case where rupturing starts at the heavy blue arrow in the middle, then continues through the lighter blue arrows. The rupture spreads to the left side (green arrows), then the right (yellow arrows).</p> <p>Depending on the extent of the rupture surface, the propagation of <strong>failures</strong> (incremental ruptures contributing to making the final rupture surface) from the point of initiation is typically completed within seconds to several tens of seconds. The initiation point isn’t necessarily in the centre of the rupture surface; it may be close to one end, near the top, or near the bottom.</p> <h1>Shifting Stress Causes Foreshocks and Aftershocks</h1> <p>Earthquakes don’t usually occur in isolation. There is often a sequence in which smaller earthquakes occur prior to a larger one, and then progressively smaller earthquakes occur after.&nbsp; The largest earthquake in the series is the <strong>mainshock</strong>.&nbsp; The smaller ones that come before are <strong>foreshocks</strong>, and the smaller ones that come after are <strong>aftershocks</strong>. These descriptions are relative, so it can be necessary to reclassify an earthquake.&nbsp; For example, the strongest earthquake in a series is classified as the mainshock, but if another even bigger one comes after it, the bigger one is called the mainshock, and the earlier one is reclassified as an aftershock.</p> <p>A rupture surface does not fail all at once.&nbsp; A rupture in one place leads to another, which leads to another.&nbsp; Aftershocks and foreshocks represent the same thing, except on a much larger scale. The rupture illustrated in Figure 12.4 reduced stress in one area, but in doing so, transferred stress to others (Figure 12.5). Imagine a frayed rope breaking strand by strand.&nbsp; When a strand breaks, the tension on that strand is released, but the remaining strands must still hold up the same amount of weight. If another strand breaks under the increased burden, the remaining strands have an even greater burden than before.&nbsp; In the same way that the stress causes one strand after another to fail, a rupture can trigger subsequent ruptures nearby.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_397" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-changes-e1439324273866.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-changes-e1439324273866.png" alt="" class="wp-image-397 size-full" width="600" height="288" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-changes-e1439324273866.png 600w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-changes-e1439324273866-300x144.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-changes-e1439324273866-65x31.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-changes-e1439324273866-225x108.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-changes-e1439324273866-350x168.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.5</strong> Stress changes related to an earthquake. Stress decreases in the area of the rupture surface, but increases on adjacent parts of the fault. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/stress-changes-e1439324273866.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a>.</em></div></div> <p>Numerous aftershocks were associated with the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck Haida Gwaii in October of 2012 (Figure 12.6; mainshock in red, aftershocks in white). Some of the stress released by the mainshock was transferred to other nearby parts of the fault, and contributed to a cascade of smaller ruptures. But stress transfer need not be restricted to the fault along which an earthquake happened. It will affect the rocks in general around the site of the earthquake and may lead to increased stress on other faults in the region. The aftershocks from the Haida Gwaii earthquake are scattered rather than located only on the main faults.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1197" style="width: 758px"><a href="#chapter-12-1-what-is-an-earthquake-2" rel="attachment wp-att-1197"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Haida_Gwaii_aftershocks.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1197" width="758" height="659" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Haida_Gwaii_aftershocks.png 758w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Haida_Gwaii_aftershocks-300x261.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Haida_Gwaii_aftershocks-65x57.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Haida_Gwaii_aftershocks-225x196.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Haida_Gwaii_aftershocks-350x304.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.6</strong> Magnitude 7.8 Haida Gwaii earthquake and aftershocks.

Aftershocks can be delayed for hours, days, weeks, or even years. Because stress transfer affects a region, not just a single fault, and because there can be delays between the event that transferred stress and the one that was triggered by the transfer, it can sometimes be hard to be know whether one earthquake is actually associated with another, and whether a foreshock or aftershock should be assigned to a particular mainshock.</p> <h1>Episodic Tremor and Slip</h1> <p><strong>Episodic tremor and slip</strong> (ETS) is periodic slow sliding along part of a subduction boundary. It does not produce recognizable earthquakes, but does produce seismic tremor (observed as rapid seismic vibrations on instruments). It was first discovered on the Vancouver Island part of the Cascadia subduction zone by Geological Survey of Canada geologists Herb Dragert and Gary Rogers.<span class="footnote">Rogers, G. and Dragert, H. (2003). Episodic tremor and slip on the Cascadia subduction zone: The chatter of silent slip. <em>Science, 300,</em> 1942-1943.</span></p> <p>The boundary between the subducting Juan de Fuca plate and the North America plate can be divided into three segments (Figure 12.7). The cold upper part of the boundary is the <strong>locked zone</strong>. There the plates are stuck together for long periods of time. When slip does occur, it generates very large earthquakes. The last time the locked zone along Canada’s west coast slipped was January 26, 1700. It caused an earthquake of magnitude 9. The warm lower part of the boundary, called the <strong>continuous slip zone</strong>, is sliding continuously because the warm rock is weaker. The central part of the boundary, the <strong>ETS zone</strong>, isn’t cold enough to be stuck, but isn’t warm enough to slide continuously. Instead it slips episodically approximately every 14 months for about 2 weeks, moving a few centimetres each time.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_399" style="width: 764px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor-1024x469.png" alt="" class="wp-image-399" width="764" height="350" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor-1024x469.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor-300x137.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor-768x352.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor-65x30.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor-225x103.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor-350x160.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Episodic-tremor.png 1077w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.7</strong> Episodic tremor and slip along the Cascadia subduction zone.

In the intermediate (ETS) zone, the plate alternately sticks and slips on a regular schedule. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Episodic-tremor.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>It might seem that periodic slip along this part of the plate helps to reduce tension, and thus reduce the risk of a large earthquake. In fact, the opposite is likely the case. The movement along the ETS part of the plate boundary transfers stress to the adjacent locked part of the plate. During the two-week ETS period, the transfer of stress means an increased chance of a large earthquake.</p> <p>Since 2003, ETS processes have also been observed in subduction zones in Mexico and Japan.</p> <h4>Additional Resources</h4> <p><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/121028queencharlotte.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IRIS Teachable Moment slides for the October 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake </a></p> <h4>References</h4> <p>Wang, K., Jiangheng, H., Schulzeck, F., Hyndman, R.

Some parts of the spring will be stretched, and others compressed.

S-waves can be simulated by fixing one end of a rope to a solid surface, then giving the other end a flick (Figure 12.8, bottom). Any one point on the rope will move from side to side at a right angle to the direction in which the snaking motion is traveling. The “S” in S-wave stands for secondary, because S-waves are slower than P-waves, and are detected after the P-waves are measured. S-waves cannot travel through liquids.</p> <p>P-waves and S-waves can travel rapidly through geological materials, at speeds many times the speed of sound in air.</p> <h2>Surface Waves</h2> <p>When body waves reach Earth’s surface, some of their energy is transformed into surface waves, which travel along Earth’s surface. Two types of surface waves are <strong>Rayleigh waves</strong> and <strong>Love waves</strong> (Figure 12.9). Rayleigh waves (R-waves) are characterized by vertical motion of the ground surface, like waves rolling on water. Love waves (L-waves) are characterized by side-to-side motion. Notice that the effects of both kinds of surface waves diminish with depth in Figure 12.9.</p> <p>Surface waves are slower than body waves, and are detected after the body waves. Surface waves typically cause more ground motion than body waves, and therefore do more damage than body waves.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_410" style="width: 1024px"><a href="#chapter-12-2-measuring-earthquakes"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface-1024x264.png" alt="" class="wp-image-410 size-large" width="1024" height="264" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface-1024x264.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface-300x77.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface-768x198.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface-65x17.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface-225x58.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface-350x90.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/seismic-surface.png 1425w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.9</strong> Surface waves travel along Earth’s surface and have a diminished impact with depth.

An instrument that combines a seismometer with a device for recording the waves is called a s<strong>eismograph</strong>. The graphical output from a seismograph is called a <strong>seismogram</strong>. Figure 12.10 (right) shows how a seismograph works. The instrument consists of a frame or housing that is firmly anchored to the ground. A mass is suspended from the housing, and can move freely on a spring. When the ground shakes, the housing shakes with it, but the mass remains fixed. A pen attached to the mass moves up and down on a rotating drum of paper, drawing a wavy line, the seismogram. The seismograph in Figure 12.10 (right) is oriented to measure vertical ground motion. The photo on the left shows a seismograph oriented to record horizontal ground motion.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1392" style="width: 864px"><a href="#chapter-12-2-measuring-earthquakes"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/seismograph.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1392 size-full" width="864" height="383" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/seismograph.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/seismograph-300x133.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/seismograph-768x340.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/seismograph-65x29.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/seismograph-225x100.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/seismograph-350x155.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.10</strong> How a seismograph records earthquakes. <em>Source: Left- Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 modified after IRIS (2012) “How Does a Seismometer Work?” <a href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/fact-sheet/how_does_a_seismometer_work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a>; Right: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY-SA 4.0, photo by Z22 (2014) CC BY-SA 3.0 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seismogram_at_Weston_Observatory.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a>.

However, unless an earthquake causes a large amount of ground motion directly beneath the seismograph, the height of the wave recorded on paper might be very small, making the seismogram difficult to analyze. The seismograph on the right has a device to amplify the ground motion, drawing larger waves that are easier to study.</p> <p>Modern seismographs record shaking as electrical signals, and are able to transmit those signals. This means seismologists need not return to the instrument to collect recordings before the records can be examined.</p> <h1>Finding The Location of an Earthquake</h1> <p>P-waves travel faster than S-waves. As the waves travel away from the location of an earthquake, the P-wave gets farther and father ahead of the S-wave. Therefore, the farther a seismograph is from the location of an earthquake, the longer the delay between when the P-wave arrival is recorded, and the S-wave arrival is recorded. The delay between the P-wave and S-wave arrival appears as a widening gap in a diagram of P-wave and S-wave travel times (Figure 12.11, grey lines).</p> <p>P-wave and S-wave arrival times can be identified on seismograms. In the three seismograms in Figure 12.11, the arrivals of the P-waves and S-waves are marked with arrows, and the interval in minutes between the P-wave and S-wave arrivals are noted. The seismograms were recorded at three different <strong>seismic stations</strong> (earthquake monitoring locations equipped with seismographs). The distance of each station from the earthquake is determined by finding the distance along the graph where the gap between the P-wave and S-wave travel-time curves matches the delay between P-wave and S-wave arrivals on the seismogram.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1397" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/travel_time_IRISmod.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/travel_time_IRISmod.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1397" width="720" height="559" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/travel_time_IRISmod.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/travel_time_IRISmod-300x233.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/travel_time_IRISmod-65x50.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/travel_time_IRISmod-225x175.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/travel_time_IRISmod-350x272.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.11</strong> Using P-wave and S-wave travel times to determine how far seismic waves have travelled.

The correction depends on how seismic waves interact with the specific rock types through which they travel, and therefore on local conditions, so the Richter magnitude is also referred to as the <strong>local magnitude</strong>.</p> <p>While news reports about earthquakes might still refer to the “Richter scale” when describing magnitudes, the number they report is most likely the <strong>moment magnitude</strong>. The moment magnitude is calculated from the <strong>seismic moment</strong> of an earthquake. The seismic moment takes into account the surface area of the region that ruptured, how much displacement occurred, and the stiffness of the rocks. Moment magnitude can capture the difference between short earthquakes and longer ones resulting from larger ruptures, even of both types of earthquakes generate the same amplitude of waves. The moment magnitude scale is also better for earthquakes that are far from the seismic station.

A key factor is the nature of the underlying geological materials. The weaker the underlying materials, the more likely it is that there will be strong shaking. Areas underlain by strong solid bedrock tend to experience far less shaking than those underlain by unconsolidated river or lake sediments.</p> <p>An example of this effect is the 1985 M8 earthquake that struck the Michoacán region of western Mexico, southwest of Mexico City. There was relatively little damage near the epicentre, but 350 km away in heavily populated Mexico City there was tremendous damage and approximately 5,000 deaths. The reason is that Mexico City was built largely on the unconsolidated and water-saturated sediment of former Lake Texcoco. These sediments resonate at a frequency of about two seconds, which was similar to the frequency of the body waves that reached the city. Consequently, the shaking was amplified.&nbsp; Survivors of the disaster recounted that the ground in some areas moved up and down by approximately 20 cm every two seconds for over two minutes. Damage was greatest to buildings between 5 and 15 storeys tall, because they also resonated at around two seconds, which amplified the shaking.</p> <h4>References</h4> <p>Ammon, C. J. (2001).

Some are related to the buildup of stress due to continental rifting or the transfer of stress from other regions, and some are not well understood. Locations include the Great Rift Valley area of Africa, the Lake Baikal area of Russia, and Tibet.</p> <h1>Earthquakes at Divergent and Transform Plate Boundaries</h1> <p>Earthquakes along divergent and transform plate margins are shallow (usually less than 30 km deep) because below those depths, rock is too hot and weak to avoid being permanently deformed by the stresses in those settings. If deformation is permanent, then removing the stress does not result in the rocks snapping back to their original shape. No snapping back means no shaking.</p> <p>Mid-ocean ridge divergent plate margins are offset by numerous transform faults (Figure 12.17). The locations of earthquakes along mid-ocean ridges, and the mechanisms for causing them, depend on how rapidly the mid-ocean ridges are spreading. The&nbsp;Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (left) is spreading relatively rapidly at 42 to 94 mm/year, depending on the location along the ridge.&nbsp; Rapid spreading causes rocks near the axis of the spreading centre to be hot and weak. As a result, most of the earthquakes (white dots) are located along transform faults, where rocks are cooler and stronger. Along rapidly spreading ridges, new ocean crust is bent upward into wide, high ridges. As spreading proceeds and crust moves away from the ridge, the bend is relaxed, and the crust stretches and breaks. This triggers earthquakes many kilometres away from the ridge.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1226" style="width: 1080px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1226" width="1080" height="378" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq.png 1080w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq-300x105.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq-768x269.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq-1024x358.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq-225x79.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Div_Trans_Eq-350x123.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.17</strong> Locations of earthquakes of magnitude 4 and greater from 1990 to 2010 along two mid-ocean ridges.

Faulting is “disorganized” within the continental crust. There is no well-established spreading centre, unlike mid-ocean ridges. Another reason is that the locations of faults, and thus earthquakes, in continental rift zones are affected by pre-existing geological structures within continental crust. In the case of the Lake Baikal rift, the strong, ancient crust of the Siberian Craton influences the orientation of the faults forming the rift. Faults run parallel to the craton near Lake Baikal. As rifting extends to the east, the part of the craton in the upper right of Figure 12.18 may deflect rifting southward.</p> <h1>Earthquakes at Convergent Boundaries</h1> <h2>Subduction Zones</h2> <p>Along convergent plate margins with subduction zones, earthquakes range from shallow to depths of up to 700 km. Earthquakes occur where the two plates are in contact, as well as in zones of deformation on the overriding plate, and along the subducting slab deeper within the mantle. The result is that epicentres of earthquakes farther to the interior of the overriding plate will correspond to increasingly deep earthquakes.</p> <p>Where the Pacific plate subducts beneath the North American plate, forming the Aleutian volcanic arc (Figure 12.19), earthquakes increase in depth moving northward, following the Pacific plate into the mantle. Earthquakes between 0 and 33 km deep (red circles) occur closest to the subduction zone (red line; teeth point in the direction of the subducting slab). While there is some overlap, earthquakes between 33 and 70 km deep (white circles) occur in a band that reaches farther the north. Farthest north are the epicentres for earthquakes between 70 and 300 km deep (green dots). The deepest earthquake during the seven year interval shown in Figure 12.19 is represented by the large green dot farthest to the north. It occurred at a depth of 265 km.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1236" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Conv_Aleut_Eqs.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Conv_Aleut_Eqs.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1236" width="720" height="478" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Conv_Aleut_Eqs.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Conv_Aleut_Eqs-300x199.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Conv_Aleut_Eqs-65x43.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Conv_Aleut_Eqs-225x149.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Conv_Aleut_Eqs-350x232.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.19</strong> Earthquakes of M4.5 and greater from 2010 to 2017 along the Aleutian Trench subduction zone (red line; teeth point in the direction of the subducting slab).

Stresses associated with the collision of two plates cause deformation in the overriding plate, and thus shallow earthquakes. Shallow earthquakes also happen on the subducting slab when a locked zone (orange line, Figure 12.20) ruptures. The locked zone is where the largest earthquakes on Earth, called <strong>megathrust earthquakes</strong>, occur. There is the potential for a wider rupture zone on a gently dipping subduction zone boundary compared to other boundaries.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1261" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1-1024x605.png" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1261" width="1024" height="605" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1-1024x605.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1-300x177.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1-768x454.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1-65x38.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1-225x133.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/SZearthquakes-1-350x207.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.20</strong> Factors contributing to earthquakes in subduction zones. Not all factors shown here are present in all subduction zones. Stress from bending, flexing, and stretching may cause ruptures. Changes in the mechanical properties of the mantle may affect how subucting slabs move, contributing additional stresses. The histogram at right shows the global average number of earthquakes at depth, for earthquakes greater than M5. The increase in earthquakes beneath 480 km may be caused in part by weakening as olivine transforms into high pressure/temperature polymorphs. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2017) CC BY 4.0. Modified after Green et al. (2010).</em></div></div> <p>If subduction is rapid, the subducting plate will bend more as it enters the mantle (slab A in Figure 12.20), causing the upper edge of the plate to stretch, and the interior and lower edge to be compressed. Stress from bending can cause shallow to intermediate earthquakes on these plates. Even without bending, the subducting slab can become stretched by its own weight as it falls into the mantle.</p> <p>The 410 km and 660 km discontinuities in Figure 12.20 mark boundaries where minerals transform into other, denser minerals that are stable at higher pressures and temperatures. When the subducting slab reaches the 660 km discontinuity (the top of the lower mantle), the increase in density in the surrounding mantle may slow down the leading edge of the sinking slab. Earthquakes can be generated when the slab is compressed by the lower mantle resisting its motion at the same time that the upper part of the slab continues to fall.</p> <p>Slower rates of subduction mean that the subducting slab will enter the mantle at a lower angle (slab B in Figure 12.20). These slabs might not have earthquakes from being bent downward into the mantle, as with slab A, but earthquakes may be triggered by changes in stress if the plate relaxes and unbends.</p> <p>The bar chart on the right of Figure 12.20 shows global average number of earthquakes that occur at different depths. Earthquakes are most abundant at the surface, and then fall to a minimum at 300 km. The number of earthquakes remains low until almost 500 km depth, and reaches a second peak around 600 km depth. The second peak might be explained by interactions between the subducting plate and the dense mantle beneath the 660 km discontinuity, but another hypothesis is that it is related to delayed mineral transformations. The subducting slab warms as it goes deeper into the mantle, but the warming is not uniform. The outer edges of the slab will warm before the interior does. The 410 km discontinuity is where olivine is transformed into the minerals wadsleyite and ringwoodite under normal mantle pressure and temperature conditions. However, if the interior of the subducting slab is still too cool at that depth, olivine will be retained to depths below 410 km. Olivine weakens prior to transforming into the high pressure minerals, and the weakening may make it easier for the slab to rupture.</p> <h2>Continent-Continent Convergence Zones</h2> <p>Where continents collide, earthquakes are scattered over a much wider area compared to earthquakes along mid-ocean ridges, transform margins, or subduction zones. An example is where the Indian plate collides with the Eurasian plate (Figure 12.21). At one time, India was a separate continent, and ocean crust separated India from the Eurasian plate. For a time, a subduction zone existed where ocean lithosphere from the Indian plate subducted beneath the Eurasian plate. But when the two land masses finally met, they became locked together and the subduction zone was closed off. Today the Indian plate is still pushing against the Eurasian plate in the regions indicated by the red arrows in Figure 12.21. The collision is accommodated by transform boundaries along the Indian plate. Regions of overall transform motion are indicated in Figure 12.21 with blue arrows.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1268" style="width: 648px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Inda_Asia_EQ.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Inda_Asia_EQ.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1268" width="648" height="569" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Inda_Asia_EQ.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Inda_Asia_EQ-300x263.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Inda_Asia_EQ-65x57.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Inda_Asia_EQ-225x198.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Inda_Asia_EQ-350x307.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.21</strong> Earthquakes of M4.5 and greater from 1990 to 2017 along the collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates.

Deeper earthquakes may be caused by continued northwestward subduction of part of the Indian plate beneath the Eurasian plate in this area. Even though the area is no longer a subduction zone, the subducted slab still remains, and is subject to stresses that can trigger earthquakes.</p> <p>Some of the earthquakes in Figure 12.21 are related to the transform faults on either side of the Indian plate, and most of the others are related to the squeezing caused by the continued convergence of the Indian and Eurasian plates. That squeezing has caused the Eurasian plate to be thrust over the Indian plate, building the Himalayas and the Tibet Plateau to enormous heights. Most of the earthquakes of Figure 12.21 are related to the thrust faults shown in Figure 12.22 (and to hundreds of other similar ones that cannot be shown at this scale). The southernmost thrust fault in Figure 12.22 (the Main Boundary Fault) is equivalent to the convergent boundary in Figure 12.21.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_406" style="width: 969px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary.png" alt="" class="wp-image-406 size-full" width="969" height="508" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary.png 969w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary-300x157.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary-768x403.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary-65x34.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary-225x118.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/India-Asia-convergent-boundary-350x183.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.22</strong> Schematic diagram of the India-Asia convergent boundary, showing examples of the types of faults along which earthquakes are focused. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/India-Asia-convergent-boundary.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a> after D.

Some intraplate earthquakes are related to human activities. When humans trigger earthquakes it is referred to as <strong>induced seismicity</strong>. In Saskatchewan there have been 20 earthquakes since 1985 (all less than magnitude 4), and the majority occurred near potash mines. Excavation changes the stress in surrounding rocks, so earthquakes may occur in the rocks above excavated parts of the mine. In Alberta, induced seismicity is triggered by hydraulic fracturing operations when water pressure increases along existing faults, causing them to slip.</p> <p>Intraplate earthquakes not related to human activities often occur along ancient rift zones. In eastern Canada, the Charlevoix seismic zone (approximately 100 km northeast of Québec City; Figure 12.23), is associated with a rift-zone faults that developed when an ancient ocean basin began to form more than 500 million years ago. Coincidentally, the rocks of the Charlevoix Seismic Zone are also fragmented because of a meteorite impact (the crater margin is indicated by the blue circle in Figure 12.23), weakening them further. While the Charlevoix zone is far from any boundary of the North American plate, tectonic forces acting on plate boundaries are still transmitted to the interior of the continent, contributing to the stress that causes the faults along the rift zone to rupture. </p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1281" style="width: 576px"><a href="#chapter-12-3-earthquakes-and-plate-tectonics-2" rel="attachment wp-att-1281"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/12/Charlevoix_ISZ.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1281" width="576" height="514" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/12/Charlevoix_ISZ.png 576w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/12/Charlevoix_ISZ-300x268.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/12/Charlevoix_ISZ-65x58.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/12/Charlevoix_ISZ-225x201.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/12/Charlevoix_ISZ-350x312.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.23</strong> Charlevoix seismic zone, site of intraplate earthquakes.

The types and extent of impacts will depend on local conditions where the earthquake strikes. The geological materials in the area matter, as does the type of terrain, and whether the region is near the coast or not. The extent of impact and type of damage will depend on whether the area is predominantly urban or rural, densely or sparsely populated, highly developed or underdeveloped. It will depend on whether the infrastructure has been designed to withstand shaking.</p> <h1>Damage to Structures from Shaking</h1> <p>As with the example of the 1985 Mexico earthquake, the geological foundations&nbsp;on which structures are built will affect the amount of shaking that occurs. Earthquakes produce seismic waves that vibrate at different rates, or <strong>frequencies</strong>. Waves with rapid vibrations have a high frequency, and waves with slower vibrations have lower frequencies.</p> <p>The energy of the higher frequency waves tends to be absorbed by solid rock. Lower frequency waves pass through solid rock without being absorbed, but are absorbed and amplified by soft sediments. It is therefore very common to see much worse earthquake damage in areas underlain by soft sediments than in areas of solid rock. During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, parts of a two-layer highway in the Oakland area near San Francisco collapsed where they were built on soft sediments (Figure 12.24).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_414" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cypress-Freeway.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cypress-Freeway.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-414" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cypress-Freeway.jpg 600w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cypress-Freeway-300x201.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cypress-Freeway-65x43.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cypress-Freeway-225x150.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cypress-Freeway-350x234.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.24</strong> A collapsed section of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland California. <em>Source: U.

Buildings can be designed to withstand most earthquakes, and this practice is increasingly applied in earthquake-prone regions. Turkey is one such region, but even though Turkey had a relatively strong building code in the 1990s, adherence to the code was poor. Builders did whatever they could to save costs, including using inappropriate materials in concrete, and reducing the amount of steel reinforcing. The result was more than 17,000 deaths in the 1999 M7.6 Izmit earthquake (Figure 12.25). After two devastating earthquakes that year, Turkish authorities strengthened the building code further, but the new code has been applied only in a few regions, and enforcement of the code is still weak, as revealed by the amount of damage from a M7.1 earthquake in eastern Turkey in 2011.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1428" style="width: 864px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1428" width="864" height="326" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS-300x113.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS-768x290.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS-65x25.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS-225x85.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Izmit_1999_USGS-350x132.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.25</strong> Damage from the 1999 M7.6 Izmit, Turkey earthquake. <em>Source: Left; USGS (1999) Public Domain <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Izmit_eart2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a>; Right: USGS (1999) Public Domain <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Izmit_eart3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Structures underlain by sediments may be at risk of another hazard, called <strong>liquefaction</strong>, in which sediment is transformed into a fluid. When water-saturated sediments are shaken, the grains may lose contact with each other, and no longer support one another. Water between the grains holds them apart, causing the sediment to turn to mud and flow. The loss of support can lead to the collapse of buildings or other structures that might otherwise have sustained little damage. During the 1964 M7.6 earthquake in Niigata, Japan, liquefaction caused buildings to sink into the sediments (Figure 12.26).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1433" style="width: 755px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Niigata.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Niigata.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1433" width="755" height="504" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Niigata.jpg 755w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Niigata-300x200.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Niigata-65x43.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Niigata-225x150.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Niigata-350x234.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.26</strong> Collapsed apartment buildings in the Niigata area of Japan.

The region is characterized by a 2 m to 3 m thick layer of fluvial silt and clay above a layer of water-saturated fluvial sand that is at least 10 m thick (Figure 12.27). Under these conditions, seismic shaking can be amplified, and the sandy sediments will liquefy. This could lead to subsidence and tilting of buildings. Liquefaction can also contribute to slope failures and to fountains of sandy mud (sand volcanoes) in areas where there is loose saturated sand beneath a layer of more cohesive clay. Current building-code regulations in the Fraser delta area require that measures be taken to strengthen the ground beneath multi-story buildings prior to construction.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_420" style="width: 744px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-420" width="744" height="457" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers-1024x629.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers-300x184.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers-768x472.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers-65x40.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers-225x138.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers-350x215.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers.png 1437w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.27</strong> Recent unconsolidated sedimentary layers in the Fraser River delta area (top) and the potential consequences in the event of a damaging earthquake. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 </em><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/unconsolidated-sedimentary-layers.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>view source</em></a></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Experiments with Liquefaction</h3> <p>To see liquefaction for yourself, go to a sandy beach and find a place near the water’s edge where the sand is wet. While standing in one place on a wet part of the beach, start moving your feet up and down at a frequency of about once per second. Within a few seconds the previously firm sand will start to lose strength, and you’ll gradually sink in up to your ankles.</p> <p>If you can’t get to a beach, put some sand into a small container, saturate it with water, and then pour the excess water off. Shake the container gently to get the water to separate and then pour the excess water away. You may have to do this more than once. Place a small rock on the surface of the sand. It should sit there for hours without sinking in. Now, holding the container in one hand gently thump the side or the bottom with your other hand, about twice a second. The rock should gradually sink in as the sand around it becomes liquefied.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_421" style="width: 617px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction-1024x465.png" alt="" class="wp-image-421" width="617" height="280" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction-1024x465.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction-300x136.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction-768x348.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction-65x29.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction-225x102.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction-350x159.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Liquefaction.png 1384w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.28</strong> Fine, damp sand before shaking (left) and after (right). <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Liquefaction.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>As you were moving your feet up and down or thumping the container, it’s likely that you soon discovered the most effective rate for getting the sand to liquefy. Stepping up and down as fast as you can (several times per second) on the wet beach would not have been effective, nor would you have achieved much by stepping once every several seconds. The body of sand vibrates most readily in response to shaking that is close to its natural harmonic frequency, and liquefaction is also most likely to occur at that frequency.</p> </div> <h1>Slope Failure</h1> <p>Ground shaking during an earthquake can be enough to weaken rock and loose materials to the point of failure.

Most of the damage in the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake was caused by massive fires in the downtown area of the city (Figure 12.30). Some 25,000 buildings were destroyed by those fires, which were fueled by gas leaking from broken pipes. Fighting the fires was difficult because water mains had also ruptured. Today the risk of fires can be reduced through P-wave early warning systems if utility operators can decrease pipeline pressure and break electrical circuits.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1434" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning-1024x244.jpg" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1434" width="1024" height="244" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning-1024x244.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning-300x72.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning-768x183.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning-65x16.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning-225x54.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SanFranburning-350x84.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.30</strong> Fires in San Francisco following the 1906 earthquake. <em>Source: Pillsbury Picture Co.

When an earthquake happens, the plate rebounds over an area of thousands of square kilometres, generating waves- a <strong>tsunami</strong> (Figure 12.31, middle). The waves spread across the ocean at velocities of several hundred kilometres per hour.

In the deep ocean, the waves may be so small as to go undetected by ships, but when they are slowed down by interacting with the ocean floor, they can become much taller (Figure 12.31, bottom). In the tsunami following the 2004 Sumatra earthquake, the tallest waves were more than 30 m high.</p> <p>Subduction earthquakes must be large to generate significant tsunami. Earthquakes with magnitude less than 7 do not typically generate significant tsunami because the amount of vertical displacement of the sea floor is minimal. Sea-floor transform earthquakes, even large ones (M7 to M8), don’t typically generate tsunami either, because the motion is mostly side to side, not vertical.</p> <p>Tsunami can have an impact across an entire ocean basin. They spread across the ocean at velocities of several hundred kilometres per hour, and can make it to the far side of an ocean in about the same time as a passenger jet. In 1700 a rupture along the Cascadia thrust fault running from Vancouver Island to northern California resulted in a M9 earthquake. It generated a tsunami that travelled across the Pacific Ocean, and was recorded in Japan nine hours later. A computer simulation of the tsunami (Figure 12.32) shows how long it took tsunami waves from the Cascadia earthquake to travel across the Pacific Ocean, and how high the waves were. Notice that over all, the waves decrease in height moving away from the rupture, but they increase in height again as they reach the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_423" style="width: 638px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami-1024x779.png" alt="" class="wp-image-423" width="638" height="485" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami-1024x779.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami-300x228.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami-768x584.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami-65x49.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami-225x171.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami-350x266.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tsunami.png 1052w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.32</strong> Computer simulation of the tsunami from the 1700 M9 Cascadia earthquake.

Many methods of prediction that have been explored. These include using observations of warning foreshocks, changes in magnetic fields, episodic tremor and slip, changing groundwater levels, strange animal behaviour, patterns in the timing between earthquakes, and how stress is transferred after a rupture. So far, none of these has provided a reliable method. Although there are some reports of successful earthquake predictions, they are rare, and many are surrounded by doubtful circumstances.</p> <h1>The Parkfield Prediction Experiment</h1> <p>There was great hope for earthquake predictions late in the 1980s when attention was focused on part of the San Andreas Fault at Parkfield, approximately 200 km south of San Francisco, California. Between 1881 and 1965 there were five earthquakes at Parkfield. They were spaced at approximately 20-year intervals, all confined to the same 20 km-long segment of the fault, and all very close to M6 (Figure 12.33). Both the 1934 and 1966 earthquakes were preceded by small foreshocks exactly 17 minutes before the main quake.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_425" style="width: 703px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment-1024x434.png" alt="" class="wp-image-425" width="703" height="298" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment-1024x434.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment-300x127.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment-768x325.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment-65x28.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment-225x95.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment-350x148.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Parkfield-segment.png 1209w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.33</strong> Earthquakes on the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault between 1881 and 2004. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Parkfield-segment.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>The U. S. Geological Survey recognized this as an excellent opportunity to understand earthquakes and earthquake prediction, so they armed the Parkfield area with a huge array of geophysical instruments and waited. The next earthquake was expected to happen around 1987, but nothing happened! The “1987 Parkfield earthquake” finally struck in September 2004. Fortunately, all of the equipment was still there to record the earthquake, but it was no help from the perspective of earthquake prediction. There were no significant precursors to the 2004 Parkfield earthquake in any of the parameters measured, including tremors, changes in rock deformation, the magnetic field, the electrical conductivity of the rock, and <strong>creep</strong> (motion along the fault that is not accompanied by earthquakes). There was no foreshock. In other words, even though every available technique was used to monitor it, the 2004 earthquake came with no warning whatsoever.</p> <h1>Earthquake Probabilities</h1> <p>To be useful to the public and governments, earthquake predictions must be accurate <em>most </em>of the time, not just <em>some</em> of the time. If a prediction method is only accurate 10% of the time (and even that isn’t possible with the current state of knowledge), the public will lose faith in the process very quickly, and then will ignore all of the predictions. The hope for earthquake prediction is not dead, but it was hit hard by the Parkfield experiment.</p> <p>Today the focus of efforts in earthquake-prone regions is to provide forecasts of <strong><span style="font-family: Times">earthquake probability</span></strong>. Earthquake probabilities express the likelihood that an earthquake of a given magnitude will occur at a location within a given period of time. An example of this approach for the San Francisco Bay region of California is shown in Figure 12.34. Based on a wide range of information, including past earthquake history, accumulated stress from plate movement, and known stress transfer, seismologists and geologists have predicted the likelihood of a M6.7 or greater earthquake on each of eight major faults that cut through the region. The greatest probabilities are on the San Andreas, Rogers Creek/Hayward faults, and Calaveras/Paicines faults. There is a 72% chance that a major and damaging earthquake will take place somewhere in the region prior to 2043.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1448" style="width: 648px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SF_probability_2014.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SF_probability_2014.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1448" width="648" height="913" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SF_probability_2014.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SF_probability_2014-213x300.png 213w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SF_probability_2014-65x92.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SF_probability_2014-225x317.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/SF_probability_2014-350x493.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 12.34</strong> Earthquake outlook for 2014-2047.

Building safe infrastructure requires strong building codes, and enforcement of those codes. Building code compliance is robust in most developed countries, but is inadequate in many developing countries.</p> <p>New buildings are not the only ones requiring attention. Existing buildings — especially schools and hospitals — and other structures such as bridges and dams, must also be made safe. British Columbia began a multi-billion-dollar program in 2004 to make public schools safer for students. The program is focused on older public schools, because, according to the government, those built since 1992 already comply with modern seismic codes. Some schools would require too much work to make upgrading economically feasible and they are replaced. Where upgrading is feasible, the school is assessed carefully before any upgrade work is initiated. The seismic mitigation program identified 346 schools as being at high risk and in need of upgrades. As of December 2017, upgrades were completed at 168 schools, 28 schools were under construction or had approval to proceed with construction, and 150 did not yet have plans in place for upgrades.</p> <p>The program in British Columbia illustrates a challenge with seismic upgrades of public buildings, which is that governments must make adequate funds available for the upgrades to be done in a timely manner. The priority allocated to funding those projects will depend on how urgent the need for upgrades is considered to be, given other demands on public funds.</p> <h1>Earthquake Preparedness</h1> <p>Earthquake preparedness involves the formulation of public emergency plans, including escape routes, medical facilities, shelters, and food and water supplies. It also includes personal planning, such as emergency supplies (food, water, shelter, and warmth), escape routes from houses and offices, and communication strategies (with a focus on ones that don’t involve the cellular network).</p> <h4>References</h4> <p>Finn, W.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-12-summary-2" title="Chapter 12 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">87</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 12 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>12.1 What Is an Earthquake?</h3> <p>An earthquake is the shaking that results when a deformed body of rock snaps back to its original shape. The rupture is initiated at a point but quickly spreads across the area of a fault, with aftershocks initiated by stress transfer. Episodic tremor and slip is a periodic slow movement, accompanied by harmonic tremors, along the middle part of a subduction zone boundary.</p> <h3>12.2 Measuring Earthquakes</h3> <p>Earthquakes produce seismic waves that can be measured by a seismograph. The amplitudes of seismic waves are used to determine the amount of energy released by an earthquake- its magnitude. For the moment magnitude scale used today, the amount of energy released by an earthquake is proportional to the size of the rupture surface, the amount of displacement, and the strength of the rock. Intensity is a measure of the amount of shaking that occurs, and damage done at locations that experience an earthquake. Intensity will vary depending on the distance to the epicentre, the depth of the earthquake, and the type of geological materials present.</p> <h3>12.3 Earthquakes and Plate Tectonics</h3> <p>Most earthquakes happen at or near plate boundaries. Along divergent and transform boundaries earthquakes are shallow (less than 30 km depth), but at convergent boundaries they can be hundreds of kilometers beneath the surface. The largest earthquakes happen when a broad segment of the locked zone of a subduction zone ruptures. Intraplate earthquakes happen away from plate boundaries. They can be caused by human activities, or renewed motion on ancient faults.</p> <h3>12.4 The Impacts of Earthquakes</h3> <p>Damage to buildings is the most serious consequence of most large earthquakes. The amount of damage is related to the type and size of buildings, how they are constructed, and the nature of the material on which they are built. Other important consequences are fires, damage to bridges and highways, slope failures, liquefaction, and tsunami.</p> <h3>12.5 Forecasting Earthquakes and Minimizing Impacts</h3> <p>There is no reliable technology for predicting earthquakes, but the probability of one happening within a certain time period can be forecast. We can minimize earthquake impacts by ensuring that the public is aware of the risk, that building codes are enforced, that existing buildings like schools and hospitals are seismically sound, and that both public and personal emergency plans are in place.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>What causes the shaking during an earthquake?</li> <li>What is a rupture surface, and how does the area of a rupture surface relate to earthquake magnitude?</li> <li>What is an aftershock and how are aftershocks related to stress transfer?</li> <li>Episodic slip on the middle part of the Cascadia subduction zone is thought to increase the stress on the locked zone.

Rocks under stress can deform elastically. When rocks break, or a rupture occurs along an existing fault, the deformed rocks snap back to their original shape, causing vibrations. The vibrations are the shaking felt during earthquakes.</p> <p>2. The rupture surface is the surface over which there is displacement of rock during an earthquake. The magnitude of an earthquake is proportional to the area of the rupture surface.</p> <p>3. An aftershock is an earthquake that is triggered when a rupture from a previous earthquake has transferred too much stress to rocks, causing further ruptures.</p> <p>4. Episodic slip on the middle part of the Cascadia subduction zone decreases stress within that area, but some of that stress is transferred to the locked zone along the plate boundary. This increases the amount of stress on the locked part.</p> <p>5. Magnitude is the amount of energy released by an earthquake. Each earthquake has only one magnitude, although there are different ways of measuring it, and they may give slightly different results. Intensity is a measure of the amount of damage done or what people felt. Intensity varies depending on the distance to the epicentre and the type of rock or sediment underlying an area.</p> <p>6. Each unit increase in magnitude corresponds to a 32x increase in energy. The difference between M5 and M7 is two units of magnitude. An earthquake that is two magnitude units larger would release 32 x 32 = 1,024 times as much energy.</p> <p>7.  a) A: Slowly spreading mid-ocean ridge- earthquakes are shallow and evenly distributed; B: Subduction zone- earthquakes range in depth; C: Rapidly-spreading mid-ocean ridge- earthquakes are shallow, and occur in patches, corresponding to a greater likelihood of earthquakes where transform faults offset ridges.</p> <p>b) The plate to the right of the chain of earthquakes is the subducting plate. The earthquakes increase in depth moving from right to left, indicating that the subducting slab is getting deeper farther to the left.</p> <p>8. Unconsolidated sediments, especially if they are saturated with water, can lose strength when subjected to earthquake shaking. This can cause buildings to subside or tilt. Unconsolidated sediments can also amplify the vibrations of an earthquake.</p> <p>9. Gas lines and electrical transmission wires are typically damaged during an earthquake, and this can lead to serious fires.</p> <p>10. A large subduction-zone earthquake (greater than M7.5) can generate a tsunami because those earthquakes result in sufficient vertical displacement of the sea floor.</p> <p>11. The 2004 Parkfield earthquake showed that we cannot rely on foreshocks to predict earthquakes, or on any of the many other parameters that were being carefully measured around Parkfield in the years leading up to the quake.</p> <p>12. We should know about the history of past large earthquakes, the typical locations of small earthquakes, the types of geological materials beneath the surface (especially soft water-saturated sediments), the types of infrastructure that is present, and the various ways that people can be evacuated from an area or assistance can be brought in.</p> <p>13. Forecasting involves estimating the risk of an earthquake happening in a region within a period of time. Prediction involves stating that an earthquake is likely to happen at a certain location on a specific day or month or year in the future. With our current state of knowledge of earthquakes, prediction is not possible.</p> </div></div>

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-13-1-stress-and-strain-2" title="13.1 Stress and Strain"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">89</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">13.1 Stress and Strain</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>Plate collisions and the accumulated weight of overlying rocks exert forces on rocks at depth. While the size of the force is important, it also matters whether the force is distributed over a wide region, or tightly focused on a small area. The same force will have a greater effect when acting over a small area than when acting over a larger area. If you have ever used snowshoes to walk across a snow bank without sinking in, you have taken advantage of the effects of distributing force (your mass acted upon by gravity) over a wider area (the area of your snowshoes rather than the soles of your boots). <strong>Stress</strong> is force adjusted for the area over which it is distributed. <strong>Strain</strong> is the change in shape that happens when rocks are deformed by stress.</p> <h1>Types of Stress</h1> <p>Stresses fall into two categories: <strong>normal stress</strong> acts at right angles to a surface, and <strong>shear stress</strong> acts parallel to a surface (Figure 13.2).  Normal stress is subdivided into <strong>compression</strong>, when the stresses are squeezing a rock, and <strong>tension</strong>, when stress is pulling it apart. Rocks undergo compression in regions where plates are colliding, or where they are being buried beneath other rocks. Rocks experience tension where divergence is happening, such as when a continent is beginning the rifting process.  Shear stress is characteristic of transform plate boundaries, where plates are moving side by side.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_432" style="width: 620px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542-1024x542.png" alt="" class="wp-image-432" height="328" width="620" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542-300x159.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542-768x407.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542-65x34.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542-225x119.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/stress-1024x542-350x185.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.2</strong> Rocks can be affected by normal stress (compression and tension) or shear stress. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2016) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <p>Although Figure 13.2 shows only one set of stress arrows for each scenario, rocks within the Earth are subject to stress from all directions.  The relative size of the stresses in different directions will determine the response of the rock. Consider a deeply buried rock being stretched as a continent breaks apart (Figure 13.3). It is also being compressed by the weight of overlying sediments and rocks, but the stress from compression is relatively small compared to the tension from rifting. The net effect of stress acting on the rock will be determined more by the tension from rifting than by the compression from overlying rocks.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1479" style="width: 504px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/diff_stress_1.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/diff_stress_1.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1479" height="199" width="504" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/diff_stress_1.png 504w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/diff_stress_1-300x118.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/diff_stress_1-65x26.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/diff_stress_1-225x89.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/diff_stress_1-350x138.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.3</strong> A rock layer (dark brown) is compressed by the weight of rocks above, and stretched by rifting. The sizes of the arrows indicate the relative sizes of the stresses. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <p>Rocks experience stress from all directions, but it is possible to break down stresses into three directions, just like a graph with x, y, and z axes. In diagrams showing these three directions, the sizes of arrows representing each direction will indicate the relative size of stresses, as they do in Figure 13.3.  Analyzing stress in this way makes it much easier to describe the stresses operating on a rock, and to understand what their net effect will be.</p> <h1>Types of Strain</h1> <p>How a rock responds to stress depends on many factors. The &#8220;how&#8221; is not simply a matter of <em>how much</em> strain a rock will undergo, but what <em>type</em> of strain will occur. Is the deformation permanent or temporary? Does the rock break or does it deform without breaking?</p> <h2>Elastic Strain</h2> <p><strong>Elastic strain</strong> is reversible strain. You can think of elastic strain as what happens to the elastic waistband of your favourite sweatpants when you put them on. The elastic stretches to let you into your pants, and once you&#8217;re in them, it shrinks to keep them from falling down. When you take the pants off again, the elastic goes back to its original shape. Similarly, rocks undergoing elastic strain will snap back to their original shape once the stress is removed. Rocks snapping back to their original shape undergo <strong>elastic rebound</strong>. Elastic rebound of rocks on a large scale can have profound consequences, because the energy released causes the Earth to vibrate. We experience those vibrations as earthquakes.</p> <h2>Plastic Strain</h2> <p>If enough stress is applied, the changes that a material undergoes to accommodate the stress will leave it permanently deformed. When the stress is removed, the material does not go back to its original shape. The permanent deformation is called <strong>plastic strain</strong>.</p> <h2>Ductile or Brittle?</h2> <p><strong>Ductile deformation</strong> refers to deformation that happens by flowing or stretching. The marble monument in Figure 13.4 is undergoing ductile deformation as it sags beneath its own weight.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1482" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Pennisi_bench_red.jpeg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Pennisi_bench_red.jpeg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1482" height="540" width="720" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Pennisi_bench_red.jpeg 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Pennisi_bench_red-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Pennisi_bench_red-65x49.jpeg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Pennisi_bench_red-225x169.jpeg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Pennisi_bench_red-350x263.jpeg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.4</strong> A marble monument at the Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland.

The potash underwent ductile deformation before it finally broke. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0</em></div></div> <h1>Factors That Determine How A Rock Will Deform</h1> <p>A rock is not limited to exclusively brittle deformation, or exclusively ductile deformation. Even the deformed rock in Figure 13.5, which has clearly undergone brittle deformation, shows a slight curvature on the right side, near the top. This indicates that a small amount of ductile deformation occurred before brittle failure.</p> <p>For a given rock, deformation will be different depending on the amount of stress applied. Up to a point, rocks undergo elastic deformation, and will spring back to their original shape after the stress is removed. If more stress is applied, the rock may deform in a ductile manner. If stress increases further, the rock may fracture. The amount of stress required in each case will depend on the type of rock, as well as conditions such as pressure and temperature.</p> <h2>Composition</h2> <p>In general, sedimentary rocks will be more likely to undergo ductile deformation than igneous or metamorphic rocks under the same conditions. Rocks within each group will also deform differently.</p> <p><strong>Boudinage</strong> structures (Figure 13.7) highlight the effect of composition on how rocks deform. These structures occur when a stronger rock more prone to brittle deformation is surrounded by weaker rocks prone to ductile deformation. The stronger rock will fracture into segments, called <strong>boudins</strong>, and the weaker rock will flow into the spaces between. In Figure 13.7 (top), the white layer reached the stage of pinching off, just before separating into segments. The surrounding black layer flowed in to fill the gap where the pinch was happening. Remarkably, the white layer itself contains a dark layer that has fragmented into boudins. Not all boudins break into blocky segments. Some display more ductile deformation (Figure 13.7, bottom).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1610" style="width: 504px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Boudinage_v2.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Boudinage_v2.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1610" height="535" width="504" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Boudinage_v2.png 504w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Boudinage_v2-283x300.png 283w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Boudinage_v2-65x69.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Boudinage_v2-225x239.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Boudinage_v2-350x372.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.7</strong> Two examples of boudinage structure.

CC BY 4.0  </em></div></div> <h2>Temperature and Pressure</h2> <p>At higher temperatures, and under higher confining pressures, rocks are more likely to undergo ductile deformation. <strong>Confining pressure</strong> is the stress that a material experiences uniformly from all sides as a result of the weight of material above and around it. The pressure that a diver feels deep in the ocean is confining pressure due to the weight of water above and around the diver. This kind of confining pressure is called <strong>hydrostatic</strong> <strong>pressure</strong>.  Within Earth, the confining pressure is due to the weight of overlying rocks. Confining pressure due to the weight of rocks is called <strong>lithostatic pressure. </strong></p> <p>The rocks in Figures 13.5 and 13.6 experienced confining pressure from the atmosphere, and temperatures comfortable for the humans working in the lab. Under those conditions the rocks ultimately underwent brittle failure when they were compressed in the lab. Deep within the crust, the temperatures and confining pressures are far greater. Deep enough within the crust, both samples would undergo only ductile deformation if the same amount of stress were applied as in the experiment. The depth at which temperatures and confining pressures are high enough for rocks to go from brittle deformation to ductile deformation is called the <strong>brittle-ductile transition zone</strong>.</p> <p>The brittle-ductile transition zone occurs between approximately 10 km and 30 km depth, corresponding to temperatures around 300 ºC and greater. The depth at which temperatures reach 300 ºC at any particular location will depend on heat flow at that location. In continental crust, rocks at 300 ºC are deeper than in ocean crust. The change in pressure with depth also varies, depending on the mass and density of rocks. If depths are measured relative to sea level, the pressure at 10 km measured beneath a tall mountain belt will be greater than the pressure at 10 km measured within ocean crust.</p> <p>Experiments like those shown in Figures 13.5 and 13.6 can be used to determine where the brittle-ductile transition zone will be for a particular rock type. Experimenters apply stress to sample of a rock for a range of temperatures and confining pressures. They note the conditions under which the rock breaks or deforms in a ductile manner, and plot those on a graph (Figure 13.8). The results in Figure 13.8 are from experiments on limestone. The vertical axis is pressure. The more pressure, the deeper the rock would have to be within the Earth to experience that pressure. The white line represents the brittle-ductile transition zone. Above the white line are pressures and temperatures under which the limestone would fracture. Below the white line in the tan area are pressures and temperatures where the limestone would deform by flowing.

Under compression, ductile deformation was possible with far less confining pressure, and at lower temperatures.</p> <p><strong>Strain rate</strong>, the rate at which deformation occurs, also makes a difference. If stress is applied at a rate that causes rapid deformation, the rock will be more likely to fracture than if deformation happens slowly. The marble slab in Figure 13.4 is a good example of this. It has sagged rather than broken because the rate of deformation has been very slow, at millimetres per decade.</p> <h2>Fluids</h2> <p>When rocks are under pressure, fluids trapped within the <strong>pore spaces</strong> of rocks- the gaps between grains- are also under pressure. Higher confining pressure is required for deformation to be ductile rather than brittle, but pressure from fluids, called <strong>pore pressure</strong>, resists the confining pressure. The result is that the effective confining pressure is lower than it would be without the fluids. Depending on the amount of pore pressure, and how close the rock is to the brittle-ductile transition zone, pore pressure could cause brittle failure in a rock that would otherwise undergo ductile deformation.</p> <h1>Stress and Geological Structures</h1> <p>Many different geologic structures can form when stress is applied to rocks. Structures form as a result of fracturing, tilting, folding, stretching, and squeezing (Figure 13.9). Some structures, like the fractures that make basalt columns (Figure 13.9, upper left), happen when rocks shrink due to cooling, but others are a consequence of plate tectonic forces. The types of structures that form depend on the plate tectonic setting and other geological conditions, making them valuable tools for understanding what happened to the rocks. The following sections address the different kinds of structures that form, and what information we can gather from these structures to learn more about the tectonic environment and regional geology.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1525" style="width: 576px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Structure_types.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Structure_types.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1525" height="560" width="576" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Structure_types.png 576w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Structure_types-300x292.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Structure_types-65x63.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Structure_types-225x219.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/01/Structure_types-350x340.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.9</strong> Structures resulting from deformation.

If the limbs slope toward the hinge zone (i.e., the hinge zone points downward), as in the fold in the left of Figure 13.11, the fold is called a <strong>syncline</strong>. If the limbs slope away from the hinge zone  (i.e., the hinge zone points upward), the fold is called an <strong>anticline</strong>.  There is an anticline on the right side of Figure 13.11. The fold in Figure 13.10 is also an anticline. Sometimes an anticline or a syncline will occur by itself, but they can also occur in a series of alternating synclines and anticlines, similar to the way the anticline and syncline share a limb in Figure 13.11. A sequence of linked anticlines and synclines is called a <strong>fold train</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1532" style="width: 864px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1532" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical.png" alt="" width="864" height="368" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical-300x128.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical-768x327.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical-65x28.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical-225x96.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fold_asymmetrical-350x149.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.11</strong> An asymmetrical syncline linked to an anticline on a beach in Cornwall, United Kingdom.

Likewise, synclines do not necessarily appear as valleys. When folded rocks erode, the landform that results depends how resistant individual layers are to erosion. For example, if the rocks in the interior of an anticline are more resistant to weathering than the surrounding rocks, a ridge will result (e.g., the low hill represented by units 4 and 5 in Figure 13.17, top). On the other hand, if rocks in the interior of the anticline are weaker, a valley will result (Figure 13.17, bottom, units d<sup>1</sup> and d<sup>2</sup>).

Joints with a common orientation make up a <strong>joint set</strong> (Figure 13.19).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1562" style="width: 650px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1562" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel-65x43.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel-225x150.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel-350x233.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/1280px-Joints_1_Rygel.jpg 1280w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.19</strong> Joint sets have broken these siltstone and shale beds into long rectangular planks. <em>Source: Michael C.

These include volcanic islands like the Hawai’ian hotspot volcanoes, and newly formed volcanic island arcs along subduction zones. But the majority of mountain building on Earth is the result of plate tectonic forces that deform Earth’s crust through faulting and folding. Mountain building through folding and faulting may or may not be supplemented by volcanic activity.</p> <h1>Mountain Building Along Convergent Margins</h1> <p>Mountain building along convergent margins is referred to as <strong>orogeny</strong>, and the mountains that are built are called <strong>orogens</strong>.</p> <h2>Ocean-Continent Collision</h2> <p>In ocean-continent collision zones, folding and faulting of rocks combines with volcanism to build mountains. An example of mountains built this way is the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Utah and Nevada. The orogeny that formed the Sierra Nevada range began around 140 million years ago.</p> <p>The mountain range was built up by igneous intrusions and volcanic eruptions along a continental volcanic arc (Figure 13.32). The terrain was altered further inland as well. Sheets of rock were thrust on top of each other, and pushed inland along a detachment fault, similar to the example of the McConnell Thrust in Figure 13.29.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1589" style="width: 967px"><a href="#chapter-13-4-mountain-building"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny-1024x339.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1589" height="320" width="967" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny-1024x339.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny-300x99.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny-768x255.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny-65x22.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny-225x75.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny-350x116.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.32</strong> Orogeny in an ocean-continent collision zone.

Sediments accumulated within that basin. The leading edge of the continent also collected sediments and igneous rock scraped off the subducting plate, forming an <strong>accretionary wedge</strong>. Over time, the force of the collision would smash the basin sediments and the accretionary wedge against the continent, turning it into new continental crust.</p> <p><strong>Continent-Continent Collision</strong></p> <p>When two continents collide, it means the closure of a subduction zone, and an end to volcanism. The Alleghenian Orogeny, which brought together North America and Africa, helping to form Pangea, is an example of mountain building in a continent-continent collision zone. Before the continents came into contact with each other, mountain building on the eastern coast of North America would have involved deformation from an ocean-continent collision, as with Figure 13.32. But as subduction proceeded, the subducting plate drew Africa closer and closer to North America. The gap between the two continents began to close, and fill with sediments (Figure 13.33, top).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1594" style="width: 883px"><a href="#chapter-13-4-mountain-building"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny_continent-continent-1024x724.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1594" height="624" width="883" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny_continent-continent-1024x724.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny_continent-continent-300x212.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny_continent-continent-768x543.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny_continent-continent-65x46.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny_continent-continent-225x159.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/orogeny_continent-continent-350x248.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.33</strong> Orogeny by continent-continent collision.

However, when the two continents collided, the subduction zone closed off and volcanism was no longer possible. As the continents smashed together, deep faults formed and stacked blocks of crust on top of each other. Old faults were reactivated. Rocks also began to shift along the boundary between an earlier orogen, the Taconic Orogen, and North America (Figure 13.33, bottom).&nbsp; When the continents had finally merged, Africa met North America along a <strong>suture zone</strong> with remnants of a continental volcanic arc on one side, and folded and faulted sedimentary rocks on the other.</p> <h1>Mountain Building Along Divergent Margins</h1> <p>When continents begin to split apart, normal faults form. This can lead to large blocks of crust that are tilted, raised, or lowered compared to adjacent blocks. Blocks that are elevated compared to adjacent blocks can form another type of mountain, called a <strong>fault-block mountain</strong>. Fault block mountains formed in eastern North America when Pangea began to split up, and Africa pulled away from North America (Figure 13.34).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1597" style="width: 856px"><a href="#chapter-13-4-mountain-building"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fault-block_mountains-1024x244.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1597" height="204" width="856" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fault-block_mountains-1024x244.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fault-block_mountains-300x72.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fault-block_mountains-768x183.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fault-block_mountains-65x16.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fault-block_mountains-225x54.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/fault-block_mountains-350x83.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.34</strong> Fault-block mountains formed in a rift zone.

It is a cliff-like feature resulting from erosion that exposed the tip of a structure like the sills in Figure 13.34.</p> </div></div>

The <strong>strike </strong>of the bed is the compass orientation of a horizontal line on the surface of the bed. The <strong>dip </strong>is the angle at which the surface tilts down from the horizontal (Figure 13.35).

Its dip would be 0˚.</p> <p>When reporting the dip, include the direction. For example, if the strike runs north-south and the dip is 30˚, it would be necessary to specify “to the west” or “to the east.”  Similarly if the strike is northeast-southwest and the dip is 60˚, it would be necessary to say “to the northwest” or “to the southeast.” In the case of the vertical wall with a dip angle of 90˚, there is no dip direction. The dip points straight down, not toward any compass direction.</p> <p>Measurement of geological features is done with a special compass that has a built-in <strong>clinometer</strong>, which is a device for measuring vertical angles. The strike is measured by aligning the compass along a horizontal line on the surface of the feature (Figure 13.36, left). The dip is measured by turning the compass on its side and aligning it along the dip direction (Figure 13.36, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1607" style="width: 648px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/compass.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/compass.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1607" height="325" width="648" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/compass.png 648w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/compass-300x150.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/compass-65x33.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/compass-225x113.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/compass-350x176.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 13.36</strong> Measurement of strike (left) and dip (right) using a geological compass with a clinometer.  <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 view source <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/figure-12.19.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a>/ <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/figure12.192.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right</a></em></div></div> <p>Strike and dip are used to describe any other planar features, including joints, faults, dykes, sills, and even the foliation planes in metamorphic rocks. Figure 13.37 shows an example of how we would depict the beds that make up an anticline on a map.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-13-summary-2" title="Chapter 13 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">94</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 13 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>13.1 Stress and Strain</h3> <p>Stress within rocks, which includes compression, extension and shearing, originates from plate tectonic processes and the weight of overlying rocks. Rock that is stressed responds with either elastic or plastic strain, and may eventually break. The way a rock responds to stress depends on its composition and structure, the rate at which strain is applied, and also on the temperature, pressure, and the presence of fluid within the rock.</p> <h3>13.2 Folding</h3> <p>Folding is generally a ductile response to compression, although some brittle behaviour can happen during folding. A fold with a hinge that points upward is an anticline. A fold with a hinge that points downward is a syncline. The axial surface of a fold can be vertical, inclined, or even horizontal. The landforms produced by folds will depend on the resistance to weathering of rock layers within the fold.</p> <h3>13.3 Fractures, Joints, and Faults</h3> <p>Joints typically form during extension, but can also form during compression. Faulting, which involves the displacement of rock, can take place during compression or extension, as well as during shearing at transform boundaries.  Thrust faults are a type of reverse fault with a fault plane tilted at a low angle. Thrust faults are common in mountain belts formed by plate collisions.</p> <h3>13.4 Mountain Building</h3> <p>Mountain building in zones of plate collision is called orogeny. The mountains that form are orogens, and consist of crust thickened and deformed by folding and faulting, as well as the intrusion of igneous rocks. Orogens in ocean-continent collision zones have volcanoes. Mountains formed in rift zones are the result of tilting of normal-faulted blocks, or some normal-faulted blocks subsiding while others remain elevated.</p> <h3>13.5 Measuring Geological Structures</h3> <p>The strike and dip of planar surfaces, such as a bedding planes, fractures or faults are measured to help understand the geological history of a region.  Special symbols are used to show the orientation of structural features on geological maps.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <p>1.

They are responsible for generating much of the topography on that land surfaces that we see around us. They are places of beauty and tranquility, and they provide much of the water that is essential to our existence. But streams are not always peaceful and soothing. During large storms and rapid snowmelts, they can become raging torrents capable of moving cars and houses, and destroying roads and bridges. When they spill over their banks, they can flood huge areas, devastating populations and infrastructure. Over the past century, many of the most damaging natural disasters in Canada have been floods.</p></div>

The area from which the water flows to form a stream is known as its drainage basin or watershed. All of the precipitation (rain or snow) that falls within a drainage basin eventually flows into its stream, unless some of this water is able to cross into an adjacent drainage basin via groundwater flow. An example of a drainage basin is shown in Figure 14.5.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_797" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Cawston-Creek.png"><img class="wp-image-797" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cawston-Creek-e1438915203759.png" alt="Figure 13.4 Cawston Creek near Keremeos, B.C.

A steep gradient has a rapid change in elevation with horizontal distance, and a shallow gradient has a slow change in elevation with horizontal distance. Cawston Creek drainage basin in BC is approximately 25 km<sup><span class="sup">2</span></sup> and is a typical small drainage basin within a very steep glaciated valley. As shown in Figure 14.6, the upper and middle parts of the creek have steep <span class="bold">gradients </span>averaging about 200 m/km but ranging from 100 to 350 m/km, and the lower part, within the valley of the Similkameen River, is relatively flat at &lt;5 m/km.</p> <p class="NormalOT">The shape of the valley has changed through time to result in the shape we see now. First, there was tectonic uplift (related to tectonic plate convergence). Then the landscape changed due to stream erosion and mass wasting (landslides). This was followed by several episodes of glacial erosion. Finally, there was post-glacial stream erosion up to the present time. The lowest elevation of Cawston Creek (275 m, where the creek flows into the Similkameen River) is its <span class="bold">base level</span>. Cawston Creek cannot erode below this level unless the Similkameen River erodes deeper into its flood plain (the area that is inundated during a flood). Base level is the elevation where a stream will no longer erode deeper into the bedrock or sediments it flows through, because the elevation of the stream does not drop below this level, and further erosion can only occur if there is an elevation drop to propel the water deeper due to the force of gravity.</p> <p>The ocean is the ultimate base level, but lakes and other rivers act as base levels &nbsp;for many smaller streams.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_798" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Cawston-Creek-profile.png"><img class="wp-image-798" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cawston-Creek-profile.png" alt="Figure 13.5 Profile of the main stem of Cawston Creek near Keremeos, B.C.

This map illustrates the concept of a drainage basin divide. The boundary between two drainage basins is the ridge of land between them. A drop of rain falling on the boundary between the Capilano and Seymour drainage basins, for example, could flow into either basin. Rain falling on the Capilano basin side cannot flow into the Seymour drainage basin, because of the drainage basin divide.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3330" style="width: 800px"><a href="#chapter-14-2-drainage-basins" rel="attachment wp-att-3330"><img class="size-full wp-image-3330" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Metro_Vancouver_Watershed_Boundaries.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="696" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Metro_Vancouver_Watershed_Boundaries.jpg 800w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Metro_Vancouver_Watershed_Boundaries-300x261.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Metro_Vancouver_Watershed_Boundaries-768x668.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Metro_Vancouver_Watershed_Boundaries-65x57.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Metro_Vancouver_Watershed_Boundaries-225x196.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/Metro_Vancouver_Watershed_Boundaries-350x305.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 14.7</strong> The three drainage basins that supply water to the metropolitan Vancouver, BC area.

Three types of drainage patterns are illustrated in Figure 14.8. <strong><span class="bold">Dendritic </span>patterns</strong>, which are by far the most common, develop in areas where the rock (or unconsolidated material) beneath the stream does not have structures that control the stream flow patterns such as folds and joints; the materials can be eroded by the stream equally easily in all directions. Most areas of British Columbia have dendritic patterns, as do most areas of the prairies and the Canadian Shield.</p> <p class="NormalOT"><strong><span class="bold">Trellis</span> drainage</strong> patterns typically develop where sedimentary rocks have been folded or tilted, and then eroded to varying degrees depending on their resistance to erosion. The Rocky Mountains of BC and AB have some fine examples of trellis drainage.</p> <p><strong>Rectangular patterns</strong> develop in areas that have very little topography and a system of bedding planes, fractures, or faults that form a rectangular network. Rectangular drainage patterns are rare in Canada</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_800" style="width: 530px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/dendritic.png"><img class="wp-image-800" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/dendritic.png" alt="Figure 13.7 Typical dendritic, trellis, and rectangular stream drainage patterns.

Over geological time, and during tectonic quiescence, a stream will erode its drainage basin into a smooth profile similar to that shown in Figure 14.10. This is called a <strong>graded stream</strong>. Graded streams are steepest in their headwaters and their gradient gradually decreases toward their mouths. <strong>Ungraded streams</strong> are still in the process of rapidly eroding and downcutting their drainage basin, they have steep sections at various points, and typically have rapids and waterfalls at numerous locations along their lengths (e.g., Cawston Creek, Figure 14.6).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_802" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/typical-graded-stream.png"><img class="wp-image-802" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/typical-graded-stream.png" alt="Figure 13.9 The topographic profile of a typical graded stream.

Base level changes can occur due to tectonic uplift or some other reason such as construction of a dam downstream. As stated earlier, the base level of Cawston Creek is defined by the level of the Similkameen River, but this can change, and has done so in the past. Figure 14.11 shows the valley of the Similkameen River in the Keremeos area. The river channel is just beyond the row of trees. The green field in the distance is underlain by material eroded from the hills behind and deposited by a small creek (not Cawston Creek) adjacent to the Similkameen River when its level was higher than it is now. Some time in the past several centuries, the Similkameen River eroded down through these deposits (forming the steep bank on the other side of the river), and the base level of the small creek was lowered by about 10 m.

Following tectonic uplift&nbsp;, the stream patterns are immature. Streams erode quickly, developing deep V-shaped valleys that tend to follow relatively straight paths. Gradients are high, and profiles are ungraded. Rapids and waterfalls are common. As the landscape matures, the streams erode wider valleys and deposited thick sediment layers. Even after maturity, gradients are slowly reduced and grading increases. In old age, streams are surrounded by rolling hills, and they occupy wide sediment-filled valleys. Meandering patterns are common, and erosion now is focussed towards the channel walls, with little downcutting.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Davis-cycle-of-erosion.png"><img class="wp-image-807" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Davis-cycle-of-erosion.png" alt="Figure 13.13 A depiction of the Davis cycle of erosion: a: initial stage, b: youthful stage, c: mature stage, and d: old age.

While some parts of his idea are out of date, it is still a useful way to understand streams and their evolution.&nbsp; Plate tectonic activity and other processes such as isostatic rebound after glaciation results in uplift that alters stream gradients, so streams are constantly adjusting due to these changing conditions. It would be relatively rare to find a stream that is able to mature through all of these stages without interruption.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercise 14.2 The Effect of a Dam on Base Level</h3> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_804" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Revelstoke-Dam-and-Revelstoke-Lake.jpg"><img class="wp-image-804" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Revelstoke-Dam-and-Revelstoke-Lake.jpg" alt="Revelstoke Dam and Revelstoke Lake on the Columbia River at Revelstoke, BC [SE]" width="250" height="175" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Revelstoke Dam and Revelstoke Lake on the Columbia River at Revelstoke, BC.

Water flow in a stream is primarily related to the stream’s gradient, but it is also controlled by the geometry of the stream channel. As shown in Figure 14.15, water flow velocity decreases due to friction along the stream bed. The stream is thus slowest at the bottom and edges and fastest near the surface and in the middle of the stream (where there is the least amount of friction). The velocity just below the surface of the water is typically a little higher than right at the surface because of friction between the water and the air. On a curved section of a stream, flow is fastest on the outside of the curve and slowest on the inside of the curve.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_808" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/relative-velocity-of-stream-flow.png"><img class="wp-image-808" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/relative-velocity-of-stream-flow.png" alt="Figure 13.14 The relative velocity of stream flow depending on whether the stream channel is straight or curved (left), and with respect to the water depth (right).

Water levels rise during a flood and due to the higher discharge of water the stream flow velocity increases. The higher discharge also increases the cross-sectional area of the stream, so it fills up the channel. In a flood it may overflow the banks. Another factor that affects stream-water velocity is the size of sediments on the stream bed. Large particles tend to slow the flow more than small ones.</p> <h1>Sediment Transport Depends on Stream Velocity and Turbulence</h1> <p class="NormalOT">If you drop a piece of gravel into a glass of water, it will sink quickly to the bottom. If you drop a grain of sand into the same glass, it will sink more slowly. A grain of silt will take longer yet to get to the bottom, and a particle of fine clay will take a long time settle out. The rate of settling is determined by the balance between gravity and friction, as shown in Figure 14.16.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_84" style="width: 152px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/grain.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-84" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/grain-225x300.png" alt="How quickly a grain settles to the bottom of a stream depends on its mass (affecting the force of gravity acting on it), and the friction between the grain and the water which slows the fall of the grain.

The faster the medium flows, the larger the particles it can move. As you probably know from intuition and from experience, streams that flow rapidly tend to be <strong>turbulent </strong>(flow paths are chaotic and the water surface appears rough) and the water may be muddy. In contrast, streams that flow more slowly tend to have <strong>laminar flow </strong>(straight-line flow and a smooth water surface) and clearer water. Turbulent flow is more effective than laminar flow at keeping sediments suspended within the water.</p> <p class="NormalOT">Particles within a stream are transported in different ways depending on their size (Figure 14.17). Large particles which rest on the stream bed are known as the <span class="bold"><strong>bedload</strong>. </span><span class="bold"><span style="font-weight: normal">The bedload m</span></span>ay only be transported when the flow rate is rapid and under flood conditions. They are transported by <strong><span class="bold">saltation </span></strong>(bouncing along, and colliding with other particles) and by <strong><span class="bold">traction</span></strong> (being pushed along by the force of the flow).</p> <p class="NormalOT">Smaller particles may rest on the bottom occasionally, where they can be transported by saltation and traction, but they can also be held in suspension in the flowing water (the <strong><span class="bold">suspended load</span></strong>), especially at higher flow velocities.</p> <p>Stream water also has a <strong>dissolved load</strong>, which represents (on average) about 15% of the mass of material transported, and includes ions such as calcium (Ca<sup>+2</sup>) and chloride (Cl<sup>&#8211;</sup>) in solution. The solubility of these ions is not affected by flow velocity.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_809" style="width: 509px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/transportation-of-sediments.png"><img class="wp-image-809" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/transportation-of-sediments.png" alt="Figure 13.15 Modes of transportation of sediments and dissolved ions (represented by red dots with + and – signs) in a stream.

This changes over time as the discharge of the river changes in response to changing weather conditions.</p> <div><h2>The Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram Summarizes What Happens to Grains of Different Sizes at Different Stream Velocities</h2> </div> <p>The faster water is flowing, the larger the particles that can be kept in suspension and transported within the flowing water. However, as Swedish geographer Filip Hjulström discovered in the 1940s, the relationship between grain size and the likelihood of a grain being eroded, transported, or deposited is not as simple as one might imagine (Figure 14.18). Consider, for example, a 1 mm grain of sand. If it is resting on the bottom of the stream, it will remain there until the flow velocity is high enough to erode it (<em>ca</em> 20 cm/s). But once it is in suspension, that same 1 mm particle will remain in suspension as long as the velocity doesn’t drop below 10 cm/s. For a 10 mm gravel grain, the velocity is 105 cm/s to be eroded from the bed but only 80 cm/s to remain in suspension.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Hjulström-Sundborg-diagram.png"><img class="wp-image-810" src="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Hjulström-Sundborg-diagram-e1438916183321.png#fixme#fixme" alt="Figure 13.16 The Hjulström-Sundborg diagram showing the relationships between particle size and the tendency to be eroded, transported, or deposited at different current velocities" width="400" height="302" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 14.18</strong> The Hjulström-Sundborg diagram showing the relationships between particle size and the tendency to be eroded, transported, or deposited, at different current velocities Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/hulstrom-2.png">view source</a></div></div> <p>On the other hand, a 0.01 mm silt particle only needs a velocity of 0.1 cm/s to remain in suspension, but requires 60 cm/s to be eroded. In other words, a tiny silt grain requires a greater velocity to be eroded than a grain of sand that is 100 times larger! For clay-sized particles, the discrepancy is even greater. In a stream, the most easily eroded particles are small sand grains between 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm. Anything smaller or larger requires a higher water velocity to be eroded and entrained in the flow. The reason for this is that small particles, especially tiny grains of clay, possess a net surface charge, hence experience a strong tendency to stick together, and so are difficult to erode from the stream bed.</p> <p class="NormalOT">It is important to be aware that a stream can both erode and deposit sediments at the same time. At 100 cm/s, for example, silt, sand, and medium gravel will be eroded from the stream bed and transported in suspension, coarse gravel will be transported by saltation and traction, pebbles will be both transported by saltation and traction, and will also be deposited, and cobbles and boulders will remain stationary on the stream bed.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercise 14.3 <strong>Understanding the Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram</strong></h3> <p>Refer to the Hjulström-Sundborg diagram in Figure 14.18 to answer these questions.</p> <ol><li>A fine sand grain (0.1 mm) is resting on the bottom of a stream bed.</li> <li>a) What stream velocity will it take to get this sand grain into suspension?</li> <li>b) Once the particle is in suspension, the velocity starts to drop.

This is known as the <strong>bank-full</strong> stage, as shown in Figure 14.19. When the flooding stream overtops its banks and occupies the wide area of its flood plain, the water has a much larger area to flow through and the velocity drops dramatically. As water flows from the channel out across the flood plain, it slows down and starts to deposit its sediment load. This forms an elevated bank known as a <strong>levee</strong> along the edges of the channel<strong>. </strong>The coarsest and thickest sediments are deposited near the channel banks, with particle size and thickness decreasing as you move further into the flood plain. People also build levees as flood control measures; the idea for this engineered solution to floods came from the naturally-build levees that form during floods.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_811" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/natural-levées.png"><img class="wp-image-811" src="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/natural-levées.png#fixme#fixme" alt="Figure 13.17 The development of natural levées during flooding of a stream.

Over time, as more and more sediments are deposited, the sediments form a distinctive triangular shape (with the bottom broad part of the triangle facing the ocean or lake and the point of the triangle facing upstream). This is called a <strong>delta</strong>; these are named after the Greek letter delta which is in the shape of a triangle. The Fraser River has created a large delta in BC where the river meets the Strait of Georgia (Figure 14.25). Much of the Fraser delta is very young in geological terms. Shortly after the end of the last glaciation (10,000 years ago), the delta did not extend past New Westminster. Since that time, all of the land that makes up Richmond, Delta, and parts of New Westminster and south Surrey has formed from sediment depositing from the Fraser River.

In this region, the drainage basins receive a lot of rain (rather than snow) during the winter and also do not remain entirely frozen throughout the winter. The Qualicum River on Vancouver Island typically has its highest discharge levels in January or February and its lowest levels in late summer (Figure 14.27). In 2013, the minimum discharge of the Qualicum River was 1.6 m<sup><span class="sup">3</span></sup>/s in August, and the maximum was 34 times higher at 53 m<sup><span class="sup">3</span></sup>/s in March.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_821" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Qualicum-River.png"><img class="wp-image-821" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Qualicum-River.png" alt="Figure 13.25 Variations in discharge of the Qualicum River during 2013.

Rapidly flowing streams become muddy, and large volumes of sediment are transported both in suspension and along the stream bed. In extreme situations, the water level reaches the top of the stream’s banks (the <strong><span class="bold">bank-full stage</span></strong>, see Figure 14.19), and if it rises further, it will overflow the banks and floods the surrounding terrain. In the case of mature or old-age streams, this could include a vast area of relatively flat ground known as a flood plain, which is the area that is typically covered with water during a major flood. Since fine river sediments are deposited on flood plains, they are ideally suited for agriculture, and thus are typically occupied by farms and residences, and in many cases, by towns or cities. Such infrastructure is highly vulnerable to damage from flooding, and the people that live and work there are at risk.</p> <p class="NormalOT">Most streams in Canada have the greatest risk of flooding in the late spring and early summer when stream discharges rise in response to melting snow. In some cases, this is exacerbated by spring storms. In years when melting is especially fast and/or spring storms are particularly intense, flooding can be very severe.</p> <p class="NormalOT">One of the worst floods in Canadian history took place in the Fraser Valley of BC in late May and early June of 1948. The early spring of that year had been cold, and a large snow pack in the interior was slow to melt. In mid-May, temperatures rose quickly and melting was accelerated by rainfall. Fraser River discharge levels rose rapidly over several days during late May, and the dykes built to protect the valley were breached in a dozen places. Approximately one-third of the flood plain was inundated, and many homes and other buildings were destroyed, but there were no deaths.</p> <p class="NormalOT">The Fraser River flood of 1948, which was the worst flood in the Fraser Valley in the past century, was followed by very high river levels in 1950 and 1972, and by relatively high levels several times since then, the most recent being 2007 (Table 13.1). In the years following 1948, millions of dollars were spent repairing and raising the existing dykes and building new ones. Since then damage from flooding in the Fraser Valley has been relatively limited.</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td> <td><strong>Year</strong></td> <td><strong>Month</strong></td> <td><strong>Date</strong></td> <td><strong>Stage (m)</strong></td> <td><strong>Discharge (m<sup>3</sup>/s)</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>1948</td> <td>May</td> <td>31</td> <td>11.0</td> <td>15,200</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>1972</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>16</td> <td>10.1</td> <td>12,900</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>1950</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>20</td> <td>9.9</td> <td>12,500</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>1964</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>21</td> <td>9.6</td> <td>11,600</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>1997</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>5</td> <td>9.5</td> <td>11,300</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>1955</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>29</td> <td>9.4</td> <td>11,300</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>1999</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>22</td> <td>9.4</td> <td>11,000</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>2007</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>10</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>10,850</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>1974</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>22</td> <td>9.3</td> <td>10,800</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>2002</td> <td>Jun</td> <td>21</td> <td>9.2</td> <td>10,600</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Table 14.1</strong> Ranking of the maximum stage and discharge values for the Fraser River at Hope between 1948 and 2008.

In this case, the floods were caused by two weeks of heavy rainfall followed by one day of exceptional rainfall. On July 19, 1996 there was 270 mm of rain, equivalent to the region’s normal rainfall for the entire month of July. Ten deaths were attributed to the Saguenay floods, and the economic toll was estimated at $1.5 billion.</p> <p class="NormalOT">Just a year after the Saguenay floods, the Red River in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Manitoba reached its highest level since 1826. As is typical for the Red River, the 1997 flooding was due to rapid snowmelt. Due to the south to north flow of the river, the flooding starts in Minnesota and North Dakota, where melting begins earlier, then extends northwards. The residents of Manitoba had plenty of warning that the 1997 flood was coming because there was severe flooding at several locations on the U.S. side of the border.</p> <p class="NormalOT">After the 1950 Red River flood, the Manitoba government built a channel around the city of Winnipeg to reduce the potential of flooding in the city (Figure 14.28). Known as the Red River Floodway, the channel was completed in 1964 at a cost of $63 million. Since then it has been used many times to alleviate flooding in Winnipeg, and is estimated to have saved many billions of dollars in flood damage. The massive 1997 flood (Figure 14.28, right side) was almost too much for the floodway; in fact the amount of water diverted was greater than the designed capacity. The floodway has recently been expanded so that it can be used to divert even more of the Red River’s flow away from Winnipeg.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_822" style="width: 524px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Red-river-Floodway.png"><img class="wp-image-822" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Red-river-Floodway.png" alt="Figure 13.26 Map of the Red river Floodway around Winnipeg, Manitoba (left), and aerial view of the southern (inlet) end of the floodway (right).

Its movement is powered by solar energy and gravity.</p> <h3>14.2 Drainage Basins</h3> <p>All of the precipitation that falls within a drainage basin flows into the stream that drains that area. Stream drainage patterns are determined by the type of rock within the basin. Over geological time, streams change the landscape that they flow within, and eventually they become graded, meaning their profile becomes a smooth curve. A stream can lose that gradation if there is renewed uplift or if their base level changes for some other reason such as construction of a dam downstream.</p> <h3>14.3 Stream Erosion and Deposition</h3> <p>The processes of erosion and deposition of particles within streams are primarily driven by the velocity of the stream water. Erosion and deposition of different-sized particles can happen simultaneously in a stream. Some particles are moved along the bottom of a river while others are carried in suspension. It takes a greater velocity of water to erode a particle from a stream bed than it does to keep it in suspension. Ions are also transported in solution. When a stream rises and then occupies its flood plain, the velocity of water over the flood plains slows and natural levees form along the edges of the stream channel.</p> <h3>14.4 Stream Types</h3> <p>Youthful streams in steep areas erode most rapidly downwards, and they tend to have steep, rocky, and relatively straight channels. Where sediment-rich streams empty into areas with lower gradients, braided streams can form. Meandering streams are common in areas with even lower gradients where silt and sand are the dominant sediments. Meandering streams erode the walls of their channels more rapidly than the channel base. Deltas form where streams flow into standing water.</p> <h3>14.5 Flooding</h3> <p>Most streams in Canada have their highest discharge rates in spring and early summer, although the highest discharge in many of BC’s coastal streams is in the winter. Floods happen when a stream rises high enough to spill over its banks and spread across its flood plain. Some of the more significant floods in Canada include the Fraser River flood of 1948, the Saguenay River flood of 1996, the Red River flood of 1997, and the Alberta floods of 2013. We can estimate the probability of a specific flood level based on the record of past floods, and we can take steps to minimize the impacts of flooding such as building floodways to divert excess water and not building in flood-prone areas.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h2>Questions for Review</h2> <ol><li>What is the proportion of liquid fresh water on Earth expressed as a percentage of all water on Earth?</li> <li>What percentage of this fresh water is groundwater?</li> <li>What type of rock, and what processes, can lead to the formation of a trellis drainage pattern?</li> <li>Why do many of the streams in the southwestern part of Vancouver Island empty into the ocean over waterfalls?</li> <li>Where would you expect to find the fastest water flow along a straight stretch of a stream?</li> <li>Sand grains can be moved by traction and saltation.

Approximately 1% of the Earth’s water is liquid fresh water.</p> <p>2. Approxmately 30% of the Earth’s fresh water is groundwater.</p> <p>3. A trellis drainage pattern typically forms on sedimentary rock that has been tilted and eroded.</p> <p>4. Many of the streams in the southwestern part of Vancouver Island flow to the ocean as waterfalls because the land has been uplifted relative to sea level over the past several thousand years.</p> <p>5. The fastest water flow on a straight stretch of a stream will be in the middle of the stream near the surface.</p> <p>6. 1 mm sand grains will be eroded if the velocity if over 20 cm/s and will be kept in suspension as long as the velocity is over 10 cm/s.</p> <p>7. If the flow velocity is 1 cm/s particles less than 0.1 mm (fine sand or finer) can be transported, while those larger than 0.1 mm cannot. At this velocity no particles can be eroded.</p> <p>8. A braided stream can develop where there is more sediment available than can be carried in the amount of water present at the rate at which that water is flowing. This may happen where the gradient drops suddenly, or where there is a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment available (e.g., following an explosive volcanic eruption).</p> <p>9. If a meander is cut off it reduces the length of a stream so it increases the gradient.</p> <p>10. The average gradient of the Fraser River between Hope and the Pacific Ocean is 0.28 m/km (or 28 cm/km).</p> <p>11. In coastal regions of B.C. the highest levels of precipitation are in the winter, and large parts of most drainage basins are not frozen solid. As a result stream discharges tend to be greatest in the winter.</p> <p>12. In most parts of Canada winter precipitation is locked up in snow until the melt season begins, and depending on the year and the location that happens in late spring or early summer. If the thaw is delayed because of a cold spring, and then happens very quickly, flooding is likely. Some regions also receive heavy rainfall during this period of the year.</p> <p>13. Ri = (n+1)/r (where n is the length of the record) and r is the rank of the flood in question. In the Ashnola River case Ri = (65+1)/2 = 33. The probability of such a flood next year is 1/Ri, or 1/33 which is 0.03 or 3%.</p> </div></div>

Mass wasting is an agent of erosion. The term “landslide” is used synonymously with the term mass wasting, but they are not the same thing. Some people reserve the term “landslide” for relatively rapid slope failures, while others do not. Due to this ambiguity, we avoid the use of the term “landslide” in this textbook.</span></p> <h1>The Hope Slide: a Historic Canadian Example of a Mass Wasting Event</h1> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Early in the morning of January 9, 1965, 47 million cubic metres of rock broke away from the steep upper slopes of Johnson Peak (16 km southeast of Hope, B.C.) and tumbled 2,000 m down the mountain, gouging out the contents of a small lake at the bottom, and continuing a few hundred metres up the other side of the valley (Figure 15.1). Four people were killed who had been stopped on the highway by a snow avalanche. Many more people might have become victims, except that a Greyhound bus driver, en route to Vancouver, turned his bus around upon seeing the avalanche. The rock failed along foliation planes of the metamorphic rock on Johnson Peak, in an area that had been eroded into a steep slope by glacial ice. There is no evidence that it was triggered by any specific event, and there was no warning that it was about to happen. Even if there had been warning, nothing could have been done to prevent it. There are hundreds of similar sites throughout mountainous regions of British Columbia and elsewhere in Canada where large mass wasting events could occur.</span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1266" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/1965-Hope-Slide-as-seen-in-2014.png"><img class="wp-image-1266" src="https://physicalgeology.pressbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44994/2015/10/1965-Hope-Slide-as-seen-in-2014.png" alt="Photograph of the site of the 1965 Hope Slide as seen in 2014.

In general, we cannot prevent most mass wasting events, and significant effort is required if an event is to be predicted with any level of certainty. Understanding the geology is critical to understanding mass wasting. Although slope failures are inevitable in a region with steep slopes, larger slope failures happen less frequently than smaller ones. The consequences of a large mass wasting event also vary depending on the downslope conditions, such as the presence of people, buildings, roads, or fish-bearing streams.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">An important reason for learning about mass wasting is to understand the nature of how and why materials fail in mass wasting events. If we understand this better, we can use this knowledge to help minimize the risks from similar events in the future. </span></p></div>

We can split the vertical gravitational force into two components (vectors) relative to the slope: one pulling the block down parallel to the slope (the <strong>shear force</strong>), and the other pulling the block directly into (i.e., perpendicular) to the slope (the <strong>normal force</strong>).</p> <p>The shear force pulls the block down the slope, but the block does not move unless the shear force overcomes (is greater than) the friction between the block and the slope. This friction holding the block on the slope may be quite weak if the block has split away from the main body of rock, or may be very strong if the block is still connected to the other rock on the slope. The strength of the relationship between the block and the slope is called the <strong>shear strength</strong>. For example, in Figure 15.2a, the shear strength is greater than the shear force, so the block will not move. In Figure 15.2b the slope is steeper, and the shear force is approximately equal to the shear strength. The block may or may not move under these circumstances. In Figure 15.2c, the slope is steeper still, so the shear force is considerably greater than the shear strength, and the block will move.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1267" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Differences-in-the-shear-and-normal-components.png"><img class="wp-image-1267" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Differences-in-the-shear-and-normal-components-1024x919.png" alt="Figure 15.2 Differences in the shear and normal components of the gravitational force on slopes with differing steepness.

In areas with relatively recent uplift (such as most of British Columbia and the western part of Alberta in Canada), slopes tend to be quite steep. This is especially true where glaciation has taken place because glaciers in mountainous terrain create steep-sided U-shaped valleys. In areas without recent uplift (such as central Canada), slopes are less steep because they have been subjected to erosion, including mass wasting, for long periods of time. Note that mass wasting can happen even on relatively gentle slopes if the shear stress acting on the materials is greater than the materials’ shear strength.</span></p> <h1>Slope Strength</h1> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">The strength of the materials on slopes can vary widely. Solid rocks tend to be strong, but rock strength varies widely, so this is not always the case. If we consider just the strength of the rocks and ignore issues such as fracturing and layering, then most crystalline rocks (e.g., granite, basalt, or gneiss) are very strong, while some metamorphic rocks (e.g., schist) are only moderately strong. Sedimentary rocks have variable strength. Dolostone and some limestone are strong, most sandstone and conglomerate are moderately strong, and some sandstone and all mudstones are quite weak.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Fractures, metamorphic foliation (excluding gneissosity and banding), or bedding can significantly reduce the strength of rock. In the context of mass wasting, this is most critical if the planes of weakness are parallel to the slope and least critical if they are perpendicular to the slope. This is illustrated in Figure 15.3. At locations A and B the bedding is nearly perpendicular to the slope and the layers of rock are relatively stable. At location D the bedding is nearly parallel to the slope and the layers of rock are relatively unstable. At location C the bedding is nearly horizontal, and the stability is intermediate between the two extremes. </span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Relative-stability-of-slopes-as-a-function-of-the-orientation-of-weaknesses.png"><img class="wp-image-1268" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Relative-stability-of-slopes-as-a-function-of-the-orientation-of-weaknesses-1024x356.png" alt="Relative stability of slopes as a function of the orientation of weaknesses (in this case bedding planes) relative to the slope orientations.

Schist, for example, may have layers that are rich in sheet silicates (micas) and these will tend to form weak layers. Some minerals tend to be more susceptible to weathering than others, and the weathered products are commonly quite weak (e.g., clay formed from feldspar). The side of Johnson Peak that failed in 1965 (Hope Slide) is made up of chlorite schist (metamorphosed sea-floor basalt) that has feldspar-bearing sills within it. The foliation and the sills are parallel to the steep slope. The schist is relatively weak to begin with, and the feldspar in the sills, which has been altered to clay, makes it even weaker.</span></p> <p>Unconsolidated sediments are generally weaker than sedimentary rocks because they are not cemented and, in most cases, have not been significantly compressed by overlying materials. Unconsolidated sediments can still bind together, and the strength of that binding is called cohesion. A cohesive sediment binds together strongly and if you picked it up with a shovel it would stick together in a lump (e.g., sand mixed with clay, clay). A sediment that is not very cohesive is weakly bound and would probably fall apart if you picked it up with a shovel (e.g., sand, silt). The deposits that make up the cliffs at Point Grey, Vancouver, B.C. include sand, silt, and clay, overlain by sand. The finer deposits at Point Grey are relatively cohesive (they maintain a steep slope, Figure 15.4 left).&nbsp; The overlying sand is not very cohesive (relatively weak) and has a shallower slope because there are many slope failures in the sand deposit.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1269" style="width: 576px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Glacial-outwash-and-Glacial-till.png"><img class="wp-image-1269" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Glacial-outwash-and-Glacial-till-1024x483.png" alt="Left: Glacial outwash deposits at Point Grey, in Vancouver.

Glacial till is typically a mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and larger clasts and forms and is compressed beneath tens to thousands of metres of glacial ice (Figure 15.4, right).</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Apart from the type of material on a slope, the amount of water that the material contains is the most important factor controlling its strength. This is especially true for unconsolidated materials (e.g., Figure 15.4), but it also applies to bodies of rock. Granular sediments, like the sand at Point Grey, have lots of pore spaces between the grains. These spaces may be completely dry (filled only with air), moist (some spaces are water filled), or completely saturated (Figure 15.5).</span></p> <p>Unconsolidated sediments tend to be strongest when they are moist because the small amounts of water at grain boundaries holds the grains together due to surface tension. Surface tension is the tension at the surface of a fluid that allows the liquid to resist an external force. Liquids always tend to acquire the lowest surface area possible; this happens because molecules at the surface of the fluid are attracted to the molecules below the surface). This is the property of liquid water that allows insects to walk over it. &nbsp;Dry sediments are held together only by the friction between grains, and if they are well sorted or well rounded, or both, this cohesion is weak, due to minimal grain contact. Saturated sediments tend to be the weakest of all because the water pushes the grains apart, decreasing friction between grains. Water will also reduce the strength of solid rock, if the rock has porosity, fractures, bedding planes, and/or clay-bearing zones, especially when the rock is saturated with water (saturated conditions).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1270" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Depiction-of-dry-moist-and-saturated-sand.png"><img class="wp-image-1270" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Depiction-of-dry-moist-and-saturated-sand.png" alt="Depiction of dry, moist, and saturated sand [SE]" width="400" height="141" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 15.5</strong> | Depiction of dry, moist, and saturated sand. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0. <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/">View source</a> </em></div></div> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Water pressure is an important factor in slope failure. As you move deeper in saturated sediment, the pressure of the water goes up due to gravity acting on the column of water above it; this pressure is called hydrostatic pressure. The greater the depth below the surface of the water table (the point where the rock or sediments are saturated), the greater the water pressure acting on the materials. Holes are often drilled into rocks in road cuts to allow water to drain and relieve this water pressure. One of the hypotheses advanced to explain the 1965 Hope Slide is that cold conditions that winter caused small springs in the lower part of the slope to freeze, preventing water from flowing out. It is possible that water pressure gradually built up within the slope, weakening the rock mass to the extent that the shear strength was no longer greater than the shear force.</span></p> </div> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Water also has an interesting effect on clay-bearing materials. All clay minerals will absorb a small quantity of water, which reduces the strength of the clay. The smectite clays (such as the bentonite used in cat litter) can absorb a lot of water, and this water pushes the clay sheets apart at a molecular level, which makes the clay swell. Smectite that has expanded in this way has almost no strength; it is extremely slippery. Thus, slopes containing smectite clay are more likely to experience slope failure when they are saturated.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Water can increase the mass of the material on a slope, because the mass of the water is a component of the overall mass of the slope material. This increases the gravitational force pulling the slope materials down. A water saturated body of sediment with 25% porosity weighs approximately 13% more than it does when it is completely dry, so the gravitational shear force is also 13% higher. In the situation shown in Figure 15.2b, a 13% increase in the shear force is enough to overcome the shear strength, and the block would move down the slope.</span></p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercise 15.1 Sand and Water</h3> <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter wp-image-1271"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1271" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Sand-and-Water-1024x768.jpg" alt="Sand and Water" width="400" height="300" /></div> <p style="text-align: center">Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0.<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/">View source</a></p> <p>If you have ever been to the beach, you already know that sand behaves differently when it is dry than it does when it is wet.

Swirl it around so that the sand remains in suspension, and then quickly tip it out onto a flat surface. It should spread out over a wide area, forming a pile with a slope of only a few degrees.</p> </div> </div> <h1>Triggers of Mass-Wasting</h1> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">In the previous section, we discussed the shear force and the shear strength of materials on slopes, and factors that can decrease the shear strength. Shear force is primarily related to slope angle, and once a slope angle is set, the shear force is constant. But shear strength can change quickly for a variety of reasons. Events that lead to a rapid decrease in shear strength are triggers for mass wasting.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">An increase in water content is the most common trigger of mass wasting. This can result from rapid melting of snow or ice, heavy rain, or other events that change the pattern of water flow on and through the material. Rapid melting can be caused by a dramatic increase in temperature (e.g., in spring or early summer), or by a volcanic eruption. Heavy rains are typically related to storms. An example of a major slope failure caused by an increase in water content was the Oso landslide that occurred in Washington State, USA in 2014 (Figure 15.6). The flow buried the community of Steelhead Haven and killed 43 people.</span></p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3278" style="width: 1000px"><a href="#chapter-15-1-factors-that-control-slope-stability" rel="attachment wp-att-3278"><img class="size-full wp-image-3278" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/OsoWA.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="662" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/OsoWA.jpg 1000w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/OsoWA-300x199.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/OsoWA-768x508.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/OsoWA-65x43.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/OsoWA-225x149.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/OsoWA-350x232.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 15.6</strong> | The Oso landslide, a flow that occurred in Washington State, USA 22 March 2014.

An example of this is a deadly 2005 debris flow in North Vancouver, B.C. This slope failure took place in an area where there had been previous slope failures. A report written in 1980 recommended that the municipal authorities and residents take steps to address surface and slope drainage issues. Unfortunately, little was done to improve the situation or to take steps that could have prevented the 2005 slope failure. The failure happened during a rainy period but was likely triggered by excess runoff related to the roads at the top of this slope and by landscape features including addition of fill to backyards in the area above the failure.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">In some cases, a decrease in water content can lead to failure. This is most common with clean sand deposits (e.g., the upper layer in Figure 15.4 (left)), which loses some of its strength when most of the water around the grains is removed (i.e., as the sand water content drops the surface tension decreases).</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Freezing and thawing can also trigger some forms of mass wasting e.g., thawing can release a block of rock that was frozen to a slope by a film of ice.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">One other process that can weaken a body of rock or sediment is shaking. The most obvious source of shaking is an earthquake. Shaking from highway traffic, construction, or mining can also weaken rock. Several deadly mass wasting events (including snow avalanches) were triggered by the M7.8 earthquake in Nepal in April 2015.</span></p> </div></div>

In most cases, the movement is parallel to a fracture, bedding plane, or metamorphic foliation plane; thus, most rock slides are translational slope failures.</p> <p>The speed of the movement can range from very slow to moderately fast. The word sackung describes the very slow motion of a block of rock (mm/y to cm/y) on a slope. A good example is the Downie Slide, a translational slide north of Revelstoke, BC, which is shown in Figure 15.9. In this case, a massive body of rock is very slowly sliding down a steep slope along a plane of weakness that is caused by the foliation in the rock. The foliation is approximately parallel to the slope.</p> <p>The Downie Slide was recognized prior to the construction of the Revelstoke Dam, and was moving very slowly at the time of dam construction (a few cm/year). Geological engineers were concerned that the presence of water in the reservoir (visible in Figure 15.9) could further weaken the plane of failure, leading to an acceleration of the motion. The result would have been a catastrophic failure into the reservoir that would have sent a wall of water over the dam and into the community of Revelstoke.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_3242" style="width: 1024px"><a href="#chapter-15-2-classification-of-mass-wasting" rel="attachment wp-att-3242"><img class="wp-image-3242 size-large" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth-1024x635.png" alt="" width="1024" height="635" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth-1024x635.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth-300x186.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth-768x476.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth-65x40.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth-225x140.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth-350x217.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/11/DownieSlideGoogleEarth.png 1053w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 15.9</strong> | The Downie Slide, a sackung, on the shore of the Revelstoke Reservoir (above the Revelstoke Dam).

Engineers and geoscientists took steps to stabilize the slope to decrease the risk of future rock falls. Rock bolts (long metal rods) were installed to anchor the blocks of rocks and prevent them falling Drainage holes were installed to drain water from the slope and decrease the water pressure. As shown in Figure 15.10, the rock along the slope is fractured parallel to the slope, and this almost certainly contributed to the failure.

This can happen during rapid spring snowmelt or heavy rains and is also relatively common during volcanic eruptions because of rapid melting of snow and ice.

This may create a temporary dam followed by a major flow of water and debris when the dam finally bursts.

Where we can neither delay nor mitigate mass wasting, we may consider trying to initiate the slope failure in a controlled manner. In areas prone to mass wasting that cannot be controlled or mitigated, we can minimize risk by not building in these areas at all.</span></p> <h1>Preventing and Delaying Mass Wasting</h1> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">It is comforting to think that we can prevent some effects of mass wasting by mechanical means. For example, the rock bolts in the road cut at Porteau Cove on the Sea-toSky highway in BC (Figure 15.10) or the drill holes used to drain water out of the slope at the Downie Slide (Figure 15.9), or the building of physical barriers, such as retaining walls along highway roadcuts. These preventative measures are not permanent though, they are subject to degradation over time. The rock bolts in the road cut at Porteau Cove will slowly start to corrode after a few years, and within a few decades many of them will begin to lose their strength. Unless they are replaced, they will no longer support the slope. Likewise, drainage holes at the Downie Slide will eventually become plugged with sediment and chemical precipitates, and unless they are periodically unplugged, their effectiveness will decrease. Eventually, unless new holes are drilled, the drainage will be compromised, and the slide will start to move again. This is why careful slope monitoring by geological and geotechnical engineers is important at major mass wasting sites such as the Downie Slide and along the Sea-to-Sky highway. Our efforts to control mass wasting are only as good as our efforts to maintain the preventive measures.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Delaying mass wasting is a worthy endeavour because during the time that the measures are still effective, they can save lives and reduce damage to property and infrastructure such as homes and roads. But we must be careful to avoid activities that could make mass wasting more likely. One of the most common anthropogenic causes of mass wasting is road construction, and this applies both to remote gravel roads built for forestry and mining, and large urban and regional highways.</span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/road-constructed-by-cutting-into-a-steep-slope.png"><img class="wp-image-1288" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/road-constructed-by-cutting-into-a-steep-slope.png" alt="Figure 15.18 An example of a road constructed by cutting into a steep slope and the use of the cut material as fill.

First, creating a flat road surface on a slope inevitably involves creating a cut bank that is steeper than the original slope. This might also involve creating a filled bank that is both steeper and weaker than the original slope (Figure 15.18). Second, roadways typically cut across natural drainage features, and unless great care is taken to reroute the runoff water, oversaturation of slope material can occur, contributing to mass wasting.</p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Apart from saturation and water pressure considerations, engineers building roads and other infrastructure on bedrock slopes have to carefully consider the geology, and especially any weaknesses or discontinuities in the rock related to bedding, fracturing, or foliation. If possible, situations like that at Porteau Cove (Figure 15.10) should be avoided — by building somewhere else — rather than trying to stitch the slope back together with rock bolts.</span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">It is widely believed that construction of buildings above steep slopes can contribute to the instability of the slope. This is likely true, but probably not because of the weight of the building. As you will determine by completing Exercise 15.3 below, a typical house is not heavier than the excavated ground that was removed to build the house. A more likely contributor to instability of the slopes below buildings is changes to the water drainage and to the saturation of the slope (by watering gardens, for example).</span></p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercise 15.3 How Much Does a House Weigh and Can It Contribute to Slope Failure?</h3> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">It is commonly believed that building a house (or some other building) at the top of a slope will add a lot of extra weight to the slope, which could contribute to slope failure. But what does a house weigh compared to the material removed when you build it? A typical 150 m<sup>2</sup> (approximately 1,600 ft<sup>2</sup>) wood-frame house with a basement and a concrete foundation weighs about 145 t (metric tonnes). But most houses are built on foundations that are excavated into the ground. This involves digging a hole and taking that material away, so we need to subtract what that excavated material weighs.

They let us know if conditions have changed at a known slide area, or if a rapid failure, such as a debris flow, is on its way downslope. The Downie Slide above the Revelstoke Reservoir is continuously-monitored with a range of devices, such as inclinometers (slope-change detectors), bore-hole motion sensors, and GPS survey instruments. A simple mechanical device for monitoring the nearby Checkerboard Slide (which is also above the Revelstoke Reservoir) is shown in Figure 15.19. Both of these slides are very slow-moving, but it is important to be able to detect changes in their rates of motion. A rapid failure would result in large bodies of rock plunging into the reservoir and sending a wall of water over the Revelstoke Dam, potentially destroying the nearby town of Revelstoke.</span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1290" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/motion-monitoring-device-at-the-Checkerboard-Slide-near-Revelstoke.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1290" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/motion-monitoring-device-at-the-Checkerboard-Slide-near-Revelstoke.jpg" alt="Figure 15.19 Part of a motion-monitoring device at the Checkerboard Slide near Revelstoke, B.C.

It would be very expensive to develop a new route in this region, so provincial authorities have taken steps to protect residents, and traffic on the highway and railway. Debris flow defensive structures have been constructed in several drainage basins, as shown in Figure 15.23.

Sometimes this may require relocating a community after discovering a previously-unidentified risk. There is a famous example of this in BC at a site known as Garibaldi, 25 km south of Whistler. In the early 1980s the village of Garibaldi had a population of about 100, with construction underway on some new homes, and plans for many more. In the months that followed the deadly 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens in Washington State, the BC Ministry of Transportation commissioned a geological study to assess risks along their highways. &nbsp;The study revealed that a steep cliff known as The Barrier (Figure 15.24) had collapsed in 1855, leading to a large rock avalanche, and that it was likely to collapse again unpredictably, putting the village of Garibaldi at extreme risk. In an ensuing court case, it was ruled that the Garibaldi site was not a safe place for people to live. Those who already had homes there were compensated, and everyone was ordered to leave.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1294" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-Barrier.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1294" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/The-Barrier.jpg" alt="Figure 15.23 The Barrier, south of Whistler, B.C., was the site of a huge rock avalanche in 1855, which extended from the cliff visible here 4 km down the valley and across the current location of the Sea-to-Sky Highway and the Cheakamus River.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-15-summary" title="Chapter 15 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">105</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 15 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>15.1 Factors That Control Stability on Slopes</h3> <p>Slope stability is controlled by the slope angle and the strength of the material on the slope. Slopes are a product of tectonic uplift, and their strength is determined by the type of material on the slope and its water content. Rock strength varies widely and is determined by internal planes of weakness and their orientation with respect to the slope. In general, the more water contained by the slope material, the greater the likelihood of failure. This is especially true for unconsolidated sediments, where excess water pushes against the grains. Addition of water is the most common trigger of mass wasting and can come from storms or rapid snow melt.</p> <h3>15.2 Classification of Mass Wasting</h3> <p>The key criteria for classifying mass wasting are the nature of the movement that takes place, the type of material, and the speed of the material movement. Mass wasting events can be a precipitous fall of rock through the air, material sliding as a solid mass along either a plane or a curved surface, or internal flow of material as a viscous fluid. The type of material influences the mass movement, specifically whether it is solid rock or unconsolidated sediments. Slope failures can have translational (planar) or rotational (curved) rupture surfaces. The important types of mass wasting are creep, slump, slide, fall, and debris flow or mudflow.</p> <h3>15.3 Preventing, Delaying, and Mitigating Mass Wasting</h3> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">We cannot prevent mass wasting, but we can delay it through efforts to strengthen the materials on slopes. Strategies include adding mechanical devices such as rock bolts or ensuring that water in the slope materials can easily drain away. Such measures are never permanent but may be effective for decades or even centuries. We can also avoid practices that make matters worse, such as cutting into steep slopes or impeding proper drainage. In some situations, the best approach is to mitigate the risks associated with mass wasting by constructing shelters or diversionary channels. In other cases, where slope failure is inevitable, we should simply avoid building in that location.</span></p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h2>Questions for Review</h2> <div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_1295" style="width: 204px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/gravitational-force-on-the-unconsolidated-sediment.png"><img class="wp-image-1295" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/gravitational-force-on-the-unconsolidated-sediment.png" alt="gravitational force on the unconsolidated sediment" width="204" height="166" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/">View source</a></div></div> <p>1.

In the geological record of climate, sedimentary deposits provide evidence of glaciations in the distant past; the chemical characteristics of sea-floor sediments tell about periods of extreme warmth. The Earth-system, and thus Earth’s climate, has not only changed frequently, but also with large temperature fluctuations. Today’s mean global temperature is approximately 16°C. During Snowball Earth episodes more than 600 million years ago, when Earth’s surface was frozen from pole to pole (or nearly so), the global mean was as cold as -50°C. At various other times in Earth history, it has been close to 30°C.</p> <p>Part of this chapter addresses natural processes of climate change, how they work, and how we know what Earth’s past climate was like. Geologists study those natural climate-change processes to understand how human-caused, or <strong>anthropogenic</strong>, changes to the Earth system might affect the climate in the future, and how much the climate has changed over the time that humans increased their influence on the Earth-system. The rest of the chapter addresses what has been learned by asking those questions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div>

The <strong>hydrosphere</strong> is the water on the planet, whether in oceans, rivers, glaciers, or the ground. The <strong>biosphere </strong>comprises living organisms. The <strong>lithosphere </strong>is the rocky outer shell of the planet.</p> <p>Components of these spheres interact constantly, with processes occurring in one sphere having an impact in other spheres. Cycles such as the water cycle or the carbon cycle constantly move matter and energy between spheres. Taking an <strong>Earth-system</strong> approach—looking at how the spheres are connected—is a way to account for the web of interactions responsible for the “big picture” of the Earth that we know.</p> <p>The climate change related to the opening of the Drake Passage (Figure 16.2) is a good example of why a system of interactions is needed to understand how Earth works. The Drake Passage (bottom left map) is the gap between the southern-most tip of South America, and Antarctica.</p> <p>Prior to 40 million years ago, the Drake Passage did not exist (top left map), and neither did the Antarctic ice cap. The arm of land connecting South America and Antarctica allowed warm ocean currents (red arrows) to carry heat from the equator to Antarctica. When the gap opened up, a new cold-water current formed (blue arrows) that blocked warm water from reaching Antarctica. Without the warm current, Antarctica froze over.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2410" style="width: 864px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2410" rel="attachment wp-att-2410"><img class="size-full wp-image-2410" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Earth-System-example.png" alt="" width="864" height="675" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Earth-System-example.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Earth-System-example-300x234.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Earth-System-example-768x600.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Earth-System-example-65x51.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Earth-System-example-225x176.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Earth-System-example-350x273.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.2</strong> An example of Earth-system interactions.

First, heat energy within Earth drove plate tectonics (lithosphere), making it possible for South America to separate from Antarctica. This impacted ocean currents (hydrosphere), and ultimately how water was stored on Antarctica (hydrosphere) by changing the climate of Antarctica.</p> <p>In the Earth system, nothing happens in isolation. The change in the climate of Antarctica had a global impact. The ice cap on Antarctica increased Earth’s <strong>albedo</strong>, the reflectiveness of Earth’s surface. The more reflective Earth’s surface, the more of the sun’s light is reflected back into space without heating Earth. This caused even more ice to form, and cooled the planet as a whole.</p> <p>When Earth cools, the change in temperature has a cascade of effects including changing precipitation patterns (hydrosphere), and changing the characteristics of habitats (biosphere). When habitats cool, organisms needing more warmth will migrate closer to the equator. This is true of plants as well as other forms of life.</p> <p>Ice is not the only type of land cover that affects albedo—forests do as well. Forests also increase local atmospheric moisture levels through transpiration, when they release water vapour into the atmosphere. Local temperature and moisture differences also affect rainfall patterns on top of larger-scale changes resulting from cooling.</p> <p>The chain of events in summarized in Figure 16.2 is only a broad overview of all of the consequences of opening a gap between South America and Antarctica. For example, it does not include the effects of what a change in the types of plants in a location does to local weathering and erosion. Trees can accelerate weathering, releasing more nutrients from rocks into runoff, which can affect algae blooms in water bodies, which in turn reduces oxygen levels in the water, which affects organisms living in the water that rely on oxygen.</p> <p>Trees growing along a river can also slow the rate of erosion, reducing the amount of sediment in the river, and ultimately the rate of development of a delta at the river’s mouth. Deltas undergo subsidence as accumulated sediments are compressed, so if the sediment supply is reduced, parts of the delta may become flooded, changing the extent of wetlands. Wetlands with waters depleted in oxygen can prevent plant material from decaying and releasing their carbon back into the carbon cycle as carbon dioxide. Changing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels alters the way energy moves through Earth’s atmosphere, and affects Earth’s surface temperatures.</p> <p>The short version of why it’s important to look at Earth as a system is that everything is connected, so that a change in one part of the system can ripple through the rest of the system and have effects well beyond any one location or time.</p> <h1>Feedbacks Amplify or Diminish Earth-System Change</h1> <p>The web of interactions in the Earth system is complex, but there is yet another level of complication. Sometimes a change in the Earth system can trigger other changes that have the effect of amplifying the original change, or diminishing it. The series of interactions that amplify or diminish a change are called <strong>feedbacks</strong>. A feedback that amplifies change is called a <strong>positive feedback</strong>. A feedback that diminishes the size of a change is called a <strong>negative feedback</strong>.</p> <p>In the events related to the glaciation of Antarctica, the formation of ice is an example of a positive feedback. Ice formation was caused by cooling, but it triggered even more cooling by reflecting sunlight away from Earth&#8217;s surface. This is called <strong>ice albedo feedback</strong>.  An example of a negative feedback is plant growth. Plants need CO<sub>2</sub> to make food, so as long as the plants have enough nutrients and water, and temperatures are still suitable, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere could increase plant growth. Plant growth would draw down atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, so that there would be less warming than would otherwise be expected from the initial rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p> <h2>Misconceptions About Feedbacks</h2> <p>There are two common misconceptions about feedbacks. One misconception is that positive feedbacks result in changes that are good, and negative feedbacks result in changes that are bad. In fact, whether a feedback is positive or negative is unrelated to whether or not the change would be considered a good thing. For example, if a feedback accelerates warming and makes an ecosystems uninhabitable for animals that used to live there, it would still be a positive feedback even though it had a negative impact on the animals in that ecosystem. A feedback that slowed the rate of warming and gave the animals time to adapt would still be considered a negative feedback even though it helped the animals to survive.</p> <p>Another misconception is that a positive feedback always results in some value increasing (e.g., a rise in temperature), and a negative feedback results in a decrease in that value. Positive feedbacks can cause a value to decrease (e.g., as ice forms more sunlight is reflected, leading to decreased temperatures), and negative feedbacks can cause a value to increase. What matters is whether the initial change is amplified or reduced, not which way the numbers are changing.</p> <h1>Feedbacks and Instability in the Earth System</h1> <p>The potential for sudden extreme changes in the Earth system depends on what feedbacks are available. At times when Earth&#8217;s climate was much warmer than today, no glaciers were present. When the climate is much cooler, a relatively small decrease in temperature could be enough to start the formation of ice and trigger the ice albedo feedback. However, if the climate is much warmer, the same decrease in temperature would not cool Earth enough to trigger the ice albedo feedback, and further climate cooling would be avoided. The reverse is also true- if warming occurs in a climate that is cold enough for glaciers to form, some of that ice might melt, reducing the albedo of Earth&#8217;s surface, and permitting even more warming. On the other hand, if the climate is already too warm for ice to exist, a small amount of warming won&#8217;t be amplified in the same way.</p> <p>The albedo effect is not the only feedback that can make cooler climates less stable. Melting of <strong><span style="font-family: Times">permafrost</span></strong> (sediment that remains frozen year round) can also have an impact. Frozen soil contains trapped organic matter that is converted by micro-organisms to CO<sub>2</sub> and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) when the soil thaws. Both these gases contribute to warming when they accumulate in the atmosphere. Additional warming can cause even more permafrost to melt, permitting even more activity by micro-organisms, and releasing more CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>.</p> <p>Either of these feedbacks is enough on their own to accelerate climate change, but when they are both present together, the effect is even stronger. What this means is that the conditions in the Earth system <em>before</em> a change happens—called the <strong>initial conditions</strong>—play an important role in determining the impact of any changes that occur. A change that would have little impact under one set of initial conditions could have far reaching effects under another. Thinking of Earth as a system is a way to factor in the initial conditions. Otherwise we would be very puzzled why a small rise in global temperatures at one time in Earth history could have almost no discernible effect, but the same rise in temperatures at another time could lead to profound change.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div></div>

The daily conditions that we think of as <strong>weather</strong>—the temperature, presence or absence of precipitation, winds, humidity, and so on—are a snapshot of the state of the Earth system at a particular instant in time and in a particular location. The weather that we get is variable, but in Saskatchewan most people would not be surprised to experience summer days with temperatures of 20 °C to 30 °C, and winter days with temperatures between –20 °C to –30 °C. Our notion of what summers and winters are generally like reflects our understanding of Saskatchewan&#8217;s <strong>climate</strong>. If we get a day in July with a daytime high of 10 °C, that would seem like unusually cold <em>weather</em> because we know it is uncharacteristic of the <em>climate</em> over all.</p> <p>We characterize the climate by collecting data about the weather every day, and then calculating the average conditions over a period of decades. The Government of Canada provides averages for the periods 1961 to 1990, 1971 to 2000, and 1981 to 2010 in an <a href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online database that is searchable by geographic location or station</a>. Data measured at Saskatoon&#8217;s Diefenbaker International Airport show that the average annual temperature from 1981 to 2010 is 0.6 °C higher than the annual average from 1961 to 1990, due warmer conditions in the winter and early spring (Figure 16.3).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2421" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2421" rel="attachment wp-att-2421"><img class="size-full wp-image-2421" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Daily_Avg_Temp_YXE.png" alt="" width="720" height="444" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Daily_Avg_Temp_YXE.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Daily_Avg_Temp_YXE-300x185.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Daily_Avg_Temp_YXE-65x40.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Daily_Avg_Temp_YXE-225x139.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Daily_Avg_Temp_YXE-350x216.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.3</strong> Average temperatures for the periods 1961 to 1990, and 1981 to 2010 measured at Saskatoon&#8217;s Diefenbaker International Airport (YXE). <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY 4.0. <a href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1961_1990_e.html?searchType=stnName&amp;txtStationName=saskatoon&amp;searchMethod=contains&amp;txtCentralLatMin=0&amp;txtCentralLatSec=0&amp;txtCentralLongMin=0&amp;txtCentralLongSec=0&amp;stnID=1473&amp;dispBack=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View YXE data for 1961 to 1990</a>. <a href="http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&amp;txtStationName=saskatoon&amp;searchMethod=contains&amp;txtCentralLatMin=0&amp;txtCentralLatSec=0&amp;txtCentralLongMin=0&amp;txtCentralLongSec=0&amp;stnID=3328&amp;dispBack=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View YXE data for 1981 to 2010</a>.</em></div></div> <p>The <em>climate</em> as represented by the 1961 to 1990 interval was slightly cooler than the <em>climate</em> represented by the 1981 to 2010 interval. People who lived in Saskatoon between 1961 and 2010 may or may not have a sense that the <em>weather</em> they experienced from day to day was different for those intervals. In fact, some may have the record high of 35.3 °C on September 4, 1978 seared into their memory, and feel that Septembers just aren&#8217;t as hot as they used to be. They would be correct that as of 2017, there are no September temperatures recorded at the Diefenbaker International Airport weather station with a daytime high greater than 35.3 °C. But if that gave them the impression that Septembers are cooler <em>on average</em> today than in the past, that would not be consistent with the data.</p> <h1>Climate-Forcing Mechanisms</h1> <p>A <strong>climate-forcing mechanism</strong> is a process that causes climate to change. Climate forcings work by initiating changes in how heat energy moves into, through, and out of the Earth system. When we discuss a particular climate change event, the climate-forcing mechanism is what initiated the change. Feedbacks also alter climate, but we want to know what triggered the feedbacks in the first place.</p> <h2>Climate Forcing by Changes in Insolation</h2> <p><strong>Insolation</strong>, or <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">in</span>coming <span style="text-decoration: underline">sol</span>ar radi<span style="text-decoration: underline">ation</span></strong>, refers to how much of the sun’s energy reaches Earth’s surface in a given period of time. Insolation is measured in Watts per square meter (W/m<sup>2</sup>).</p> <h3>Long-term Solar Evolution</h3> <p>Over the long term (billions of years), stars like our sun become larger, brighter, and hotter (Figure 16.4). Earth receives 40% more heat from the sun today than it did 4.5 billion years ago. In Figure 16.4, the blue <em>Now </em>arrow shows the sun’s current point in its life history. Although the blue arrow appears to indicate an instant in time, the time interval reflecting the duration of human existence on Earth is but a tiny fraction of the width of the line. As far as human experience is concerned, the long-term evolution of the sun is so slow that it has made no difference at all on insolation for the entire time humans have existed.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2426" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/solar_evolution.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2426" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/solar_evolution.png" alt="" width="720" height="174" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/solar_evolution.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/solar_evolution-300x73.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/solar_evolution-65x16.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/solar_evolution-225x54.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/solar_evolution-350x85.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.4</strong> The life history of a star, from condensation of a nebula, to expansion to a red giant, and ending as a white dwarf. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2017) CC BY 4.0.

Over intervals of approximately 100,000 years, the <strong>eccentricity </strong>of Earth’s orbit changes. Eccentricity is a measure of how elliptical a circle is. Higher eccentricity means that the orbit is more elliptical (Figure 16.5, left, blue orbit), whereas lower eccentricity means the orbit is more circular (Figure 16.5, left, red orbit). <strong>Eccentricity</strong> is important because when it is high, the Earth-sun distance varies more from season to season than it does when eccentricity is low.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2431" style="width: 720px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2431"><img class="wp-image-2431 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/orbital_cycles.png" alt="" width="720" height="221" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/orbital_cycles.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/orbital_cycles-300x92.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/orbital_cycles-65x20.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/orbital_cycles-225x69.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/orbital_cycles-350x107.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.5</strong> Cycles in Earth’s orbit.

Click the image for more attributions.</em></div></div> <p>Over intervals of approximately 41,000 years, the <strong>obliquity </strong>of Earth’s axis of rotation changes (Figure 16.5, middle). This results in a nodding motion that alters how directly the sun shines on Earth’s poles. When the angle is at its maximum (24.5°), Earth’s seasonal differences are accentuated. When the angle is at its minimum (22.1°), seasonal differences are minimized.</p> <p>Cycles of <strong>precession </strong>happen over intervals of approximately 20,000 years, causing Earth’s axis of rotation to wobble (Figure 16.5, right). This means that although the North Pole is presently pointing to the star Polaris (the pole star), in 10,000 years it will point to the star Vega.</p> <p>The importance of eccentricity, tilt, and precession to Earth’s climate cycles (now known as <strong>Milanković Cycles</strong>) was first pointed out by Yugoslavian engineer and mathematician Milutin Milanković in the early 1900s. Milanković recognized that although the variations in the orbital cycles did not affect the <em>total</em> amount of insolation that Earth received, it did affect <em>where</em> on Earth that energy was strongest. Glaciations are most sensitive to the insolation received at latitudes of approximately 65°. As continents are configured today, this is most significant at 65° N, because there is almost no land at 65° S.</p> <p>The most important factors are whether the northern hemisphere is pointing toward or away from the sun at its closest or farthest approach, and how eccentric the sun’s position is in Earth’s orbit. For example, if the northern hemisphere is at it farthest distance from the sun during summer (Figure 16.6, top), this means cooler summers. If the northern hemisphere is at its closest distance to the sun during summer (Figure 16.6, bottom), this means hotter summers. Cool summers — as opposed to cold winters — are the key factor in the accumulation of glacial ice, so the upper scenario in Figure 16.6 is the one that promotes glaciation. This factor is greatest when eccentricity is high.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_538" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434.png"><img class="wp-image-538 size-large" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434-1024x434.png" alt="" width="1024" height="434" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434-300x127.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434-768x326.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434-65x28.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434-225x95.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers-1024x434-350x148.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.6</strong> Effect of precession on insolation in the northern hemisphere summers.

Peaks in temperature in F correspond to peaks in the oxygen isotope record in E, which indicate that it was warmer, there was less ice, and sea level was higher. Troughs are times when Earth was deep within an ice age. It was cooler, there was ice on land, and sea level was lower.</p> <p>The vertical dashed lines on the left-hand side of Figure 16.7 mark the times of peak warm temperatures and allow for comparison of the timing of the temperature peaks with the timing of the orbital cycles. Peak temperature events are approximately 100,000 years apart, suggesting that the eccentricity cycle might be the most important contributor. Indeed, in B most (but not all) of the peak temperature events correspond to a time when Earth’s orbit was at or near peak eccentricity for that cycle.</p> <p>It is tempting to conclude that eccentricity is the most important orbital cycle for climate change over all. However, this pattern only began a little over 1 million years ago. For 1.5 million years before that, the 41,000-year obliquity cycle seems to dominate insolation cycles.</p> <p>In general, times of warmest or coolest temperatures don’t line up perfectly with orbital cycles. There is no one orbital cycle that is most important for all of Earth history. It is also the case that changes in insolation due to orbital cycles are not sufficient to cause temperatures to change as much as the geological record says they have; feedbacks must be factored in to explain the observed temperature changes.</p> <h3>Sunspot Cycles</h3> <p><strong>Sunspots</strong> are dark patches that appear on the surface of the sun as a result of intense local disturbances in the sun’s magnetic field (Figure 16.8, left). Loops of plasma (gas with electrical charge, Figure 16.8, right) follow along magnetic field lines from one sunspot to another.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2439" style="width: 603px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspots.png"><img class="wp-image-2439" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspots.png" alt="" width="603" height="298" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspots.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspots-300x148.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspots-65x32.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspots-225x111.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspots-350x173.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.8</strong> Sunspots.

For that reason you might think that more sunspots means a reduction in insolation. In fact, just the opposite is true, because sunspots are a side-effect of increased solar activity. Peaks in the number of sunspots counted annually since approximately 1870 (Figure 16.9, blue), coincide with peaks in measurements of solar energy output from the same time period (Figure 16.9, pink).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2442" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2442" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data-1024x655.png" alt="" width="1024" height="655" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data-1024x655.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data-300x192.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data-768x491.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data-65x42.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data-225x144.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data-350x224.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data.png 1366w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.9</strong> Sunspot cycles.

In the end the effect of sunspot cycles on climate can be lost amidst other factors. In Figure 16.9 there is no clear relationship between the sunspot cycles and the global average temperatures (in grey) reported for the same period.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><h3>Be Aware of Graph Scales</h3> <p>Figure 16.9 shows three kinds of data: temperatures, sunspot numbers, and solar energy flow. Each of these data sets is a different type of information, so each needs its own vertical axis. The vertical axes are scaled so that the data fill the area of the graph as much as possible. Stretching the vertical scale to fit the full plotting area makes it easier to see how well the peaks and troughs in each record line up with each other. Unfortunately, this can also skew our impression of the data. For example, in the period from 1880 to 1920, all three records have a similar vertical distance from peak to trough. In other words, all three records have approximately the same size of wiggles. This does not mean that the change in insolation from sunspot cycles was big enough to cause all of the variation in the temperature record. From this graph alone, there is no way to tell how much the change in insolation due to sunspot cycles mattered to global temperatures during the period 1880 to 1920.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> <h2>Climate Forcing by Changes in Heat Transport</h2> <p>The ocean transports large amounts of heat around the Earth through a conveyor-belt-like system of currents. The ocean has surface currents that are driven by wind, but it also has deeper currents that are not wind-driven. The deeper currents behave like stacked rivers because they are different temperatures and have different salt contents, and therefore different densities. The differences in density between these water masses are what drive circulation. Circulation that is driven by density is called <strong>thermohaline circulation</strong>; <em>thermo</em> refers to heat and <em>haline</em> refers to salt.</p> <p>To see how this works, consider the warm and saline Gulf Stream current (Figure 16.10, top). It flows northward past Britain and Iceland into the Norwegian Sea, and cools as it moves north, becoming denser. Its high salinity contributes to its density, and it sinks, or <strong>downwells</strong>, deep beneath the surrounding water, forming the <strong>North Atlantic Deep Water</strong> (NADW) current that flows south. Meanwhile, at the southern extreme of the Atlantic, very cold water adjacent to Antarctica also sinks to the bottom to become the <strong>Antarctic Bottom Water</strong> (AABW) current. The AABW flows north, beneath the NADW.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_46" style="width: 603px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section.png"><img class="wp-image-46" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section-1024x369.png" alt="" width="603" height="217" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section-1024x369.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section-300x108.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section-768x276.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section-225x81.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section-350x126.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section.png 1281w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.10</strong> A simplified north-south cross-section through the Atlantic Ocean basin showing the different current layers. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The water that sinks in the areas of deep water formation in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent to Antarctica moves very slowly at depth.

As in the example of the Drake Passage, the path of warm currents can have a significant impact on the climate of a region, and potentially of the planet as a whole. Processes that disrupt the density of seawater can slow or stop currents, preventing warm water from reaching higher latitudes. The recovery from the last ice age is characterized by sudden returns to glacial conditions over as little as 3 years. This is thought to be the result of enormous glacial lakes forming on continents as the glaciers melted, then being suddenly released into the ocean by a burst ice dam. The glacial water would be very cold, but it would also be fresh, making it less dense than the ocean water. The fresh glacial water would form a cap and slow the downwelling conveyor belt at high latitudes.</p> <p>Scientists are trying to determine the current and past state of the Atlantic-basin system of circulation, called the <strong>Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</strong> (<strong>AMOC</strong>), to tell whether it is changing in response to warming and adding fresh water from melting ice sheets. The AMOC varies considerably on decadal cycles because of cycles in the wind patterns in the Atlantic, so it is important to distinguish these cyclical changes from any longer-term underlying changes.</p> <p>Because of these studies, we have an idea of what the physical properties of the Atlantic Ocean look like when circulation is stronger or weaker. When circulation slows, the density is lower in the downwelling regions (Figure 16.12, blue patch in the Labrador Sea). The density is higher south of this region, along the eastern coast of the United States and southern Canada (Figure 16.12, orange patch). Model simulations are used to confirm that the changes in density we observe are consistent with how we understand the circulation system to work.</p> <p>Measurements of the actual flow rate at depth in the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 16.12, right, blue dots) confirm that density decreases in downwelling regions (black and red lines) when circulation slows. A more recent study (Caesar et al., 2018) has shown that observed and model temperatures follow the same pattern, with cooling where the blue patches are in Figure 16.12, and warming in the region of the orange patches. This is to be expected because the slowdown in circulation affects how heat is moved northward.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2461" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2461" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term-1024x652.png" alt="" width="1024" height="652" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term-1024x652.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term-300x191.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term-768x489.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term-65x41.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term-225x143.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/AMOC_short-term-350x223.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.12</strong> Using changing density to track circulation in the Atlantic Ocean.

(2018) have used geochemical analyses of microfossils to build a longer-term record of temperatures, then used that record to look for the temperature &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; of slowing AMOC, an increasing difference in the temperatures of surface waters compared to deeper waters in the downwelling zone (Figure 16.13, top). They observe a longer-term cooling trend beginning at the close of the Little Ice Age, suggesting that less heat is being moved toward the downwelling zone (labelled A on the globe in Figure 16.13).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2477" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2477" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al-1024x952.png" alt="" width="1024" height="952" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al-1024x952.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al-300x279.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al-768x714.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al-65x60.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al-225x209.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Thornalley-et-al-350x325.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.13</strong> Long-term record of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

Grain size is used as a substitute for a direct measure of ocean current velocity because the velocity determines what grain size can be carried. They identified a lower average grain size over the past ~150 years compared to the average grain size from earlier (Figure 16.13, bottom, dashed lines). The authors of the study note that the average grain size changes more during cold events in the Northern Hemisphere (the Dark Ages Cold Period and the Little Ice Age).</p> <p>Thornalley et al (2018) conclude that the AMOC has been weaker on average during the past ~150 years than during the previous ~1,500 years. However, they cannot say for sure how much of that change is from melting that occurred at the close of the Little Ice Age, from melting triggered by warming since the Industrial Revolution, or some combination of the two. Direct measurements of density and current velocity tell us that as of 2017, the AMOC continues to weaken.</p> </div> <h3>Plate Tectonics and Heat Transport</h3> <p>The opening of the Drake Passage is one example of how plate tectonic changes can affect ocean heat transport, and therefore climate. Plate tectonic changes that build or break up continents also play a role. When continents become large, ocean currents warm their margins, but the interiors can be much cooler. Anyone living on the Canadian prairies who has shivered through -40 °C temperatures in the winter, while watching news reports of rain in Vancouver will be familiar with this effect. When the supercontinent Gondwana was over the south pole approximately 300 million years ago (Figure 16.14), this triggered an ice age. The build-up of ice was hastened by the ice albedo feedback effect.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2483" style="width: 602px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2483"><img class="wp-image-2483" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carboniferous_Scotese.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="381" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carboniferous_Scotese.jpg 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carboniferous_Scotese-300x190.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carboniferous_Scotese-65x41.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carboniferous_Scotese-225x143.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carboniferous_Scotese-350x222.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.14</strong> Glaciation on the supercontinent Gondwana.

Earth’s various surfaces have widely differing albedos, expressed as the percentage of light that reflects off a given material. This is important because most solar energy that hits a very reflective surface is not absorbed and therefore does little to warm Earth. Water in the oceans or on a lake is one of the darkest surfaces, reflecting less than 10% of the incident light. Clouds and snow or ice are among the brightest surfaces, reflecting 70% to 90% of the incident light (Figure 16.19).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_541" style="width: 605px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339.png"><img class="wp-image-541" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339-1024x339.png" alt="" width="605" height="200" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339-300x99.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339-768x254.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339-65x22.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339-225x74.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339-350x116.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.19</strong> Typical albedo values for Earth surfaces.

Those scientists did not recognize the power of positive feedbacks. It wasn’t until 1973, 15 years after Milanković’s death, that sufficiently high-resolution data were available to show that the Pleistocene glaciations were indeed driven by the orbital cycles, and it became evident that the orbital cycles were just the first step, initiating a range of feedback mechanisms that made the climate change, many of which were related to albedo.</p> <p>Consider the following:</p> <ul><li>When large volumes of ice melt — such as the continental ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, as well as alpine glaciers— this decreases albedo. More solar energy is then absorbed by land, amplifying the increase in temperature.</li> <li>When sea ice melts and exposes water, the albedo of the exposed area decreases drastically, from approximately 80% to less than 10%. Far more solar energy can be absorbed by the water compared to the previous ice cover, amplifying the temperature increase<strong>.</strong></li> <li>Sea level rises when ice and snow melt on land, and because seawater expands when heated. Higher sea level means a larger proportion of the planet is covered with water, which has a lower albedo than land. More heat is absorbed, amplifying the temperature increase. Since the last glaciation, a rise in sea level of approximately 125 m has flooded vast areas of land.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title" style="text-align: center">Exercise: Albedo Impacts of Vegetation Changes</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>Changes in climate can cause forests to be replaced by grasslands, which have higher albedo than dark forest cover. If deserts expand, vegetated areas can be replaced by higher-albedo sand. Many human activities affect albedo, including adding urban surfaces to an environment, and planting crops. Figure 16.20 shows a forest that has been clear-cut. If a clear-cut has an albedo similar to that of sand, how would clear cutting change the albedo of the area?</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2495" style="width: 551px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2495" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="367" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon-300x200.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon-768x512.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon-65x43.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon-225x150.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon-350x233.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Clearcutting-Oregon.jpg 1280w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.20</strong> A clear-cut near Eugene, Oregon. <em>Source: Calibas (2011) CC BY-SA 3.0 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clearcutting-Oregon.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Note that trees cool their environment through transpiration, when they release water vapour from their leaves.

You might also have noticed that compared to most of the record, the rise in temperature since 1950 is unexpectedly small, given the increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels since that time. The reason for the relatively small temperature increase in response to the recent CO<sub>2</sub> increase is in large part because the recent rise in CO<sub>2</sub> is happening far more rapidly than other parts of the Earth system can respond. The ocean in particular is slowing down the response.</p> <p>The ocean takes up heat from the atmosphere, and thus helps to determine surface temperatures. A relatively cool ocean can take up more heat from the atmosphere, reducing warming. The fastest way for the ocean as a whole to take up heat is through the &#8220;stirring&#8221; that happens with ocean circulation, but circulation happens on thousand-year timescales. The slow rate of circulation means that centuries from now, there will still be cool water rising up from the deep ocean that has yet to be exposed to the warmer surface conditions. At other times in the 800,000-year record, changes in CO<sub>2</sub> levels happened on timescales much closer to those at which the ocean takes up heat.</p> </div> <h2>Atmospheric Effects of Volcanic Eruptions</h2> <p>Volcanic eruptions don’t just involve lava flows and exploding rock fragments. Eruptions also release particles and gases into the atmosphere. Important volcanic gases include water vapour, CO<sub>2</sub>, and sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). Volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can contribute to climate warming if a greater-than-average level of volcanism is sustained over a long time. At the end of the Permian Period, the massive Siberian Traps were produced by eruptions lasting at least a million years. Large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> were released, warming the climate and triggering a cascade of Earth-system responses. The end of the Permian Period at 252 Ma is marked by the greatest mass extinction in Earth history.</p> <p>Over the shorter term, however, volcanic eruptions can have the opposite effect, cooling the climate. SO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water in the atmosphere to make droplets of sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid droplets scatter sunlight, reducing how much of the sun’s energy can reach Earth’s surface. They also affect cloud formation. The volcanic cooling effect is relatively short-lived, because the particles settle out of the atmosphere within a few years.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title" style="text-align: center">Exercise: Climate Change at the end of the Cretaceous Period</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content">The large extraterrestrial impact at the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 Ma ago is thought to have produced a massive amount of dust, which may have remained in the atmosphere for several years.

The term <strong>paleoclimate </strong>refers to Earth’s climate in the past. The information we have about Earth’s past climates can be classified as <strong>direct data</strong> or <strong>proxy data</strong>. Direct data are information derived from first-hand observations of climate. Direct data can be <strong>instrumental data</strong>, derived from tools designed to quantify observations, or from qualitative descriptions.</p> <p><strong>Proxy data </strong>are information derived from natural materials with characteristics that are affected by climate in a systematic way. This could also be said of some instrumental data: an alcohol thermometer uses the fact that the volume of alcohol changes in a consistent way in response to temperature. Proxy data rely on relationships that are also as systematic and consistent, but there are important differences:</p> <ul><li>Instruments are designed so that the response of the instrument reflects only one characteristic of the environment (e.g., an alcohol thermometer is sealed so that only temperature affects the level of alcohol, not air pressure or evaporation), but proxy data may need to be carefully analyzed to account for other processes.</li> <li>Data from instruments are lost if observations are not made and recorded. A thermometer is constantly changing in response to temperature, and will not stay in a particular state once conditions change. Proxy records capture information about the environment in a way that can persist over the long term, for as long as the materials last in usable form. Some proxy records preserve information from billions of years ago.</li> <li>Instruments transform characteristics of the environment into information that we can access immediately (e.g., you can read a temperature directly from a thermometer), but materials from which we derive proxy data require processing, often with specialized laboratory equipment, to get data we can use.</li> <li>Instruments measure only what we design them to measure, and measure only as well as we design them to do so. Because proxy data come from materials that persist through time, it is possible to improve the techniques used to analyze materials, and redo earlier measurements. Discovering new proxies is an ongoing area of research, and regularly reveals ways to determine characteristics of past states of the Earth system that we didn’t think were knowable.</li> <li>Instrumental records and other direct observations can be well constrained in time. In other words, we often know the exact dates the observations were made. Proxy data may come from materials that are difficult to pin down to an exact date, and additional information may be required to determine when the records were formed. Sometimes proxy data can only be extracted as an average over a number of years. The relevant question becomes whether the resolution of the record (how detailed it is) is high enough for the time frame of interest. For example, an annual average would be no use at all to understand monthly climate variations, but would provide exceptionally high resolution for geological processes operating over tens of thousands of years.</li> </ul> <h1>Types of Direct Data</h1> <p><strong>Instrumental records</strong> of climate are those derived from tools such as thermometers, rain gauges, or satellite measurements of the extent of ice sheets. Instrumental records are a recent development, as the history of the Earth system goes. The oldest known temperature measurements cover the period from 1654 to 1670, and were made by monks and Jesuit priests who operated stations within a meteorological network supported by the Medici family of Florence.</p> <p>Non-instrumental historical records of climate also exist, and cover periods of human history prior to the development of the climate-measuring tools we have now. With detective work, these can be used to paint a detailed picture of past climates. Non-instrumental historical records include written records about how long ice and snow were present in a particular year, when harvests occurred, when floods happened, and shipping records that report the extent of sea ice. Paintings of alpine glaciers give information about how far the ice extended, and this can be used to reconstruct temperatures.</p> <div class="textbox"><h3>The Challenges of Getting Climate Information from Historical Records</h3> <p>In their paper <em>Historical Climate Records in China and Reconstruction of Past Climates</em>, Jiacheng Zhang and Thomas Crowley used official Chinese records extending as far back as 1000 CE to get a detailed picture of climate. This involved transforming descriptions of weather events into a systematic scale. One challenge is defining the scale, but another is deciding what individual accounts actually mean. The authors point out that records of rain or drought can reflect the perceptions and generalizations of the people who wrote about the weather, rather than what actually happened. Consider the following description of rainfall in 1644 from <em>Diary of Qi Zongmin</em>:</p> <p>“in Wyzhong there is no rain for six months from May”</p> <p>Does this mean there was no rain at all prior to May, or just very little? Was it actually six months since there had been rain, or is that an approximation? How do we reliably translate different systems of time measurement into durations and dates, like &#8220;six months&#8221; or &#8220;May?&#8221; How can we tell for sure where a location is if place names or political boundaries change?</p> <p>As the authors caution, &#8220;a great deal of cross-checking [is required] in order to arrive at a useful descriptive account of climate anomalies.”</p> </div> <h1>Sources of Proxy Data</h1> <h2>Tree Rings</h2> <p>The study of tree growth rings for the purpose of understanding past states of the Earth system is called <strong>dendroclimatology</strong>. Temperatures and a history of drought or wet periods can be reconstructed from the widths of tree rings. Because tree rings form annually, these records can also be well constrained in time. The widths of tree rings reflect how fast the tree grows in a given season. There are factors other than temperature and moisture that affect growth rate, so a sampling strategy must be carefully designed to ensure confidence in climate reconstructions.</p> <h2>Stable Isotopes</h2> <p>Atoms have a nucleus made of protons and neutrons. The number of protons in the nucleus determines what element the atom is, and will always be the same for a given element. In contrast, the number of neutrons can vary for an element. Versions an element having different numbers of neutrons are the <strong>isotopes</strong> of that element.</p> <p>Sometimes an atom has a number of neutrons that makes it unstable. Those atoms eventually break apart, releasing energy, and are called <strong>radioactive isotopes</strong>. The decay rate of radioactive isotopes is known, making it possible to use them to find the ages of natural materials. For example, carbon-14 dating makes use of the radioactive isotope of carbon, <sup>14</sup>C, which has eight neutrons instead of the usual number, six (the 14 refers to 6 protons + 8 neutrons).</p> <p>For investigating Earth’s past climate, <strong>stable isotopes</strong>, which do not decay, are used instead. Stable isotopes of the same element are measured in natural materials, and their ratios compared. Both isotopes are involved in the same chemical reactions and physical processes, but the slight difference in mass caused by one or two extra neutrons means that those processes are more likely to take up the lighter isotope than the heavier one. Some processes do this in such a particular way that evidence of their occurrence is left behind as a distinctive fingerprint in the stable isotope composition of materials formed in their environment.</p> <p>The pair of isotopes used to reconstruct past temperatures are the oxygen isotopes <sup>16</sup>O and <sup>18</sup>O. The ratio of <sup>18</sup>O to <sup>16</sup>O in water is reflected in the calcium carbonate of shells that form in the water. The shells may remain in the geologic record long after the water is gone, making it possible to know the oxygen isotope compositions, and thus temperatures, of water bodies that existed in the distant past.</p> <h2>Ice Cores</h2> <p>The ice in polar glaciers and mountain glaciers preserves a detailed snapshot of Earth’s atmosphere and climate. A sample of Earth’s atmosphere, including gases and particles, is captured and held within the ice, and buried beneath subsequent ice layers. The annual layers in the ice can be used to determine a timescale for the data. The gases in air bubbles trapped within ice (Figure 16.23) are analyzed to determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere at the time the gasses were trapped.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2520" style="width: 501px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/CSIRO_Antarctic_Ice_sm.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-2520" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/CSIRO_Antarctic_Ice_sm.jpeg" alt="" width="501" height="331" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/CSIRO_Antarctic_Ice_sm.jpeg 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/CSIRO_Antarctic_Ice_sm-300x198.jpeg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/CSIRO_Antarctic_Ice_sm-65x43.jpeg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/CSIRO_Antarctic_Ice_sm-225x149.jpeg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/CSIRO_Antarctic_Ice_sm-350x231.jpeg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.23</strong> A researcher holds a fragment of ice from Antarctica.

The zones run roughly along lines of latitude, so that the climate zone changes as you move north or south of the equator. When the climate warms, the zones shift away from the equator; an area now in the boreal climate zone might have been in the warm temperate climate zone when Earth’s climate was warmer. When the climate cools, the zones shift toward the equator.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2525" style="width: 602px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones.png"><img class="wp-image-2525" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones.png" alt="" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones-300x150.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones-768x384.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones-65x33.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones-225x113.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Climate_zones-350x175.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.26</strong> Six climate zones of the Köppen-Geiger classification. <em>Source: Karla Panchuk (2018) CC BY-SA 4.0.

For example, coal deposits are characteristic of a subtropical climate. Limestone with coral reef fossils is characteristic of a tropical climate. If a rock type is found outside of its climate zone, that might indicate a change in climate. Coal can be found near Estevan, Saskatchewan, now in the warm temperate climate zone. This suggests that at one time, a warmer climate resulted in a northward shift of the subtropical climate zone. Some of the oil in western Canada is present in pore spaces within ancient coral reefs. The warm temperate climate zone cannot have been at its present location when those reefs formed.</p> <p>Fossils can be used similarly. If an organism lives in a habitat with a particular climate, then evidence that the organism has migrated away from the equator could indicate warming. Migration toward the equator could indicate cooling.</p> <p>The study of pollen and plant spores, called <strong>palynology</strong>, is very helpful for determining the distribution of plants when evidence of larger plant parts (e.g., fossil leaves and bark) is absent. Pollen and spores are very tough, and will survive in the environment when other plant materials do not. A detailed record of pollen and spores, and hence of the climate zones in a particular location, can be derived from lake sediments. Lakes in climates with strong seasonality (a distinct difference in temperature as seasons progress) can accumulate distinct annual sediment layers, called <strong>varves </strong>(Figure 16.27). Each year is represented by a light layer and a dark layer. The light layers consist of sand and silt from spring runoff. The darker layers include organic matter accumulated during the year.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2528" style="width: 565px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2528"><img class="wp-image-2528" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/varves.png" alt="" width="565" height="354" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/varves.png 576w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/varves-300x188.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/varves-65x41.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/varves-225x141.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/varves-350x219.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.27</strong> Varves in a core from Canoe Brook, Drummerston, Vermont.

So, scientists use <strong>Earth-system computer models</strong> to assist. Earth-system models incorporate knowledge of the many components of the Earth system in a way that makes it possible to test how important any one change is.</p> <p>Earth-system models vary in how many aspects of the Earth system they include, and how detailed their representations of those aspects are. Models are designed to answer particular kinds of questions so their performance can be optimized; a study that is concerned only with large-scale global changes might not require a model with a highly detailed representation of Earth&#8217;s coastlines. It takes more time to run a complicated model, so this saves on computing resources.</p> <p>When computer models are discussed, we acknowledge that there is a difference between measurements of the real world, and the output from the model. Modelers are careful to refer to measurements of the real word as <em>data</em>, and output from the model as <em>results</em>. This also helps to avoid confusion when comparing models to real-world measurements to gauge how realistic the model output is.</p> <h1>What Are Computer Models, Exactly?</h1> <p>Computer models describe natural phenomena using mathematical equations. On the most basic level, computer models take some quantity—whether heat, water, or the concentration of a pollutant—and calculate how it moves through a system. Sometimes they look only at how that quantity changes through time. A computer model of the water volume in a bathtub could be limited to looking at how rapidly water flows in through the tap, and how rapidly it flows out through the drain. But sometimes models look at how a quantity changes in space as well as through time.</p> <p>A study of wind-driven currents in a lake must include information about the shape and depth of the lake to capture how friction at the lake bottom and along the sides affects water flow (Figure 16.28). Data about the lake shape and depth (Figure 16.28, top) is translated to a model grid (Figure 16.28, bottom). Calculations are done to see how wind and friction control how water moves into and out of each cell in the grid.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2542" style="width: 501px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid.png"><img class="wp-image-2542" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid.png" alt="" width="501" height="420" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid-300x251.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid-768x644.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid-65x54.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid-225x189.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/09/Lake-Ontario-grid-350x293.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.28</strong> Set-up for a model of wind-driven current flow in Lake Ontario.

Another step would be to represent the lake water using a vertical stack of several grid cells to better capture the extent to which bottom friction and wind force affect the lake water at different depths, and to do a better job of representing the water depth.</p> <h1>An Example of Using a Computer Model to Study Past Earth-System Change</h1> <p>The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a sudden global warming event that happened approximately 56 million years ago. There was interest in studying this event because its suddenness was thought to be a good analogy for the rapid changes happening in the Earth system today. Cores from ocean-floor rocks show that the oceans became so acidified during the PETM that calcium carbonate sediments dissolved over vast areas of the ocean floor, vanishing entirely from some regions. The same cores also showed a shift in the carbon-isotope composition of calcium carbonate sediments.</p> <p>Both the acidification and the carbon-isotope shift indicated that a large amount of carbon was added to the Earth system to trigger the PETM. The problem was that there were a number of possible sources for the carbon, and thus a number of possible triggers for the event. Although scientists provided reasoned arguments for their favourite hypotheses, there was no way to know for sure which was the best answer.</p> <p>To solve this problem, an Earth-system model was used that could test which scenario could best account for the pattern of dissolving calcium carbonate. It took into account the shape of ocean basins, ocean current circulation, and carbonate system chemistry in ocean water and in sediments. It also took into account changes in sediments once they were deposited.</p> <p>The steps to using this model were the following:</p> <ol><li>A search was done to locate as many studies of ocean floor sampling sites as possible that had information about changes in the amount of calcium carbonate during the PETM.</li> <li>The model was set up so that it did a good job of reproducing the distribution of calcium carbonate <em>before</em> the PETM happened. This was important to ensure that model scenarios began with a realistic set of conditions.</li> <li>Each of the possible scenarios involved carbon coming from different sources in the Earth system, meaning that each scenario could be represented in the model by adding to the atmosphere different amounts of carbon with different carbon isotope compositions. The more carbon a scenario required, the more the calcium carbonate sediments would have dissolved in real life.</li> <li>The model was run for each different amount of carbon. For each scenario, the pattern of calcium carbonate sediments that the model gave was compared to the actual distribution of calcium carbonate sediments known from the data collected in Step 1.</li> </ol> <p>In the end, the model showed that some of the scenarios did not even come close to matching the observations, either dissolving way too much calcium carbonate, or far too little. The model showed that two scenarios did come close to reproducing the pattern of calcium carbonate, and that one did a better job of matching the observations than the other. When it came time to write a report about the experiments, the scientists learned that newly published measurements from another study supported the scenario that the model suggested was best. It would have been acceptable to write a paper describing the model results, and which scenario worked best. However, also being able to comment about new supporting data meant there was a better chance of convincing other scientists that the model results were meaningful.</p> <h1>Predicting the Future of the Earth System with Models</h1> <p>Using models to investigate the Earth system requires careful consideration of how to build the model and run experiments. But it also requires skillful use of real-life measurements to set up the model, and to interpret and evaluate its results. The PETM model study was an example of how a model can be used to test hypotheses about past behaviour of the Earth system. There were data from before, during, and after the event to help set up the model and gauge its effectiveness.</p> <p>Using Earth-system models to predict the future is a different kind of modeling challenge, because we don&#8217;t already know what the right answer is. The situation being modeled hasn&#8217;t happened yet. Scientists who try to predict the future of the Earth system have to do things a bit differently in order to have some confidence in the reliability of their model outcomes:</p> <ul><li>They must come up with reasonable forcing scenarios for the model. A model used to predict the future of Earth&#8217;s climate will need input about what atmospheric greenhouse gas levels will be. That will depend on what actions humans take. Scientists deal with this unknown variable by testing multiple scenarios for greenhouse gas levels, such as what would happen if fossils fuels continue to be used as they have been, or alternatively, what would happen if we completely stopped using fossil fuels tomorrow. The scenarios they choose span a range of possibilities, including extreme cases, to make sure they understand what the possible range of outcomes could be.</li> <li>Scientists use some of the data they have to set the model up so that it is a realistic representation of the Earth system at a particular time in history. They then test the model to see if it can reproduce a different set of data later in history. This is a way to see if the model can get the right answer for a time when we know the right answer. Finally, after determining that the model gives reasonable results for times when we know the right answer, it is run for future scenarios.</li> <li>To be confident about predictions of future Earth-system change, scientists may collaborate to run their scenarios on many different Earth-system models designed by many different research groups at many different institutions. These models are set up with slightly different mathematical representations of processes, or different levels of detail in geographic representations. The scientists who built the various models might disagree on what numbers to assign some of the variables, or even which parts of the Earth system are necessary to include. If all the models produce similar results for a particular scenario in spite of representing a wide range of ideas about how such models should work, scientists can be more confident in those results.</li> <li>Scientists report <strong>uncertainty</strong> with their model results. It is a common misconception that uncertainty means the same thing as in everyday language—that we just don&#8217;t know something, or can&#8217;t say for sure. But for models, uncertainty is a number that indicates the likelihood that a model result is within a certain range of values. It is determined using methods that are themselves the product of careful research. A meaningful discussion of uncertainty will concern a specific model or set of models, a specific variable, and include a specific range of values. It will also include information about how large the uncertainty is compared to the changes they are investigating. If these details are missing from the conversation, it&#8217;s a clue that “uncertainty” is being used in a common-language way rather than the way that modellers use it. Note that reporting uncertainty is not exclusive to models predicting the future, but it is particularly important for those models because of the great scrutiny Earth-system models receive when they are used to investigate future climate change.</li> </ul> <h4>References</h4> <p class="hanging-indent">Simons, T.

Many discussions of anthropogenic climate-change place the start of human impacts on the Earth system at the beginning of the industrial era, in the mid 18th century. The industrial era was when humans began to use fossil fuels—at the time, mostly coal—on a much larger scale than before to do things like run manufacturing machinery and trains.</p> <p>Some climate scientists place the first anthropogenic impacts much earlier, however. Some suggest that anthropogenic climate change began around 8,000 BCE when humans cleared land for agriculture in Europe and the Middle East. Clearing forests for crops is a type of climate forcing because the CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity of the crops is generally lower than that of the trees they replace. Some climate scientists also point to the creation of wetlands to grow rice in Asia around 5,000 BCE. Creating wetlands is a type of climate forcing because the anaerobic bacterial decay of organic matter within wetlands produces CH<sub>4</sub>.</p> <p>Whether anthropogenic climate change began with the Agricultural Revolution or the Industrial Revolution may be a matter for debate for some, but it is clear that Earth-system change accelerated once the Industrial Revolution began. Part of this is due to the fact that agricultural activities had to be scaled up to feed an ever-growing population. When humans first started growing crops, the world population was approximately 5 million (Figure 16.31), fewer people than live in Toronto today. The world population rose to approximately 18 million when wetland rice cultivation began (fewer people than live within the city limits of Beijing today), to over 800 million at the start of the Industrial Revolution. The world population was estimated at 7,600 million in 2018.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years-.png"><img class="wp-image-545" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years-.png" alt="" width="600" height="280" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years-.png 1019w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years--300x140.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years--768x358.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years--65x30.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years--225x105.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years--350x163.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.31</strong> World population growth over the past 12,000 years. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0, <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years-.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a>.

Fossil fuels are those derived largely from plant material that grew, died, and was partially preserved at various times throughout Earth history. The plants removed CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere when they were alive, and stored it in organic compounds in their tissues. The materials accumulated over hundreds of millions of years in settings like swampy forests, shallow seas, and deltas. When fossil fuels are burned, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <h1>The Carbon-Isotope Fingerprints of Fossil Fuel</h1> <p>Carbon isotopes provide insights into the extent to which fossil fuels have impacted the Earth system, because fossil fuels have a unique carbon-isotope fingerprint that is detectable in the atmosphere and in geological materials.</p> <h3>Stable Carbon Isotopes (12-Carbon and 13-Carbon)</h3> <p>When plants transform CO<sub>2</sub> into tissues, the process imparts a unique carbon-isotope signature to the resulting organic matter. Plants preferentially take in CO<sub>2</sub> with the isotope <sup>12</sup>C over  CO<sub>2</sub> with isotope <sup>13</sup>C. They do so in a consistent way, giving plant tissues a distinctive ratio of <sup>13</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C. Fossil fuels are derived from plant materials, and they preserve this isotopic ratio.</p> <p>The ratio of <sup>13</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C is commonly expressed relative to a standard to give numbers that are easy to work with and compare. The notation δ<sup>13</sup>C refers to the ratio of <sup>13</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C in a sample compared to the ratio in a standard, and is expressed in parts per thousand (or per mil, ‰). The standard has a δ<sup>13</sup>C of 0‰. Carbon in plant tissues has a δ<sup>13</sup>C of -25‰ to -30‰, meaning it has a <sup>13</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C ratio that is 25 to 30 parts per thousand lower than the standard. Burning fossil fuel releases CO<sub>2</sub> with that ratio into the atmosphere.</p> <p>For most of the past 1000 years, the atmosphere has had a δ<sup>13</sup>C of approximately -6.5‰. The carbon-isotope composition of organic matter is much lower than that of the atmosphere, so the mixing in of carbon from fossil fuels causes the over-all carbon-isotope composition of the atmosphere to decrease. An analogy for mixing low δ<sup>13</sup>C CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere is rapidly adding cold water to a hot bathtub. The faster the cold water is added, the faster the bathwater will cool. The colder the water being added, the faster the bathwater will cool. In this analogy, the atmosphere is the bathtub, and fossil fuels are the water being added. The low δ<sup>13</sup>C value of fossil fuels (-25‰ to -30‰) is like very cold water being added.</p> <p>As we would expect, the carbon isotope composition of the atmosphere takes a sudden downward turn at the same time that humans undertake the Industrial Revolution, and begin burning large quantities of fossil fuels, adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere at an accelerating rate (Figure 16.32).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2552" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C.png"><img class="wp-image-2552" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C.png" alt="" width="600" height="426" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C-300x213.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C-768x546.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C-65x46.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C-225x160.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2_d13C-350x249.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.32</strong> A 1000-year record of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels (blue circles) and carbon isotope composition (grey circles) measured in Antarctic ice cores.

Data from Rubino et al (2013).</em></div></div> <p>Scientists who study past climates on Earth are familiar with carbon-isotope records like this one, because such records are used to reconstruct major changes in the Earth system through their impact on the carbon cycle. In carbon-isotope records from the distant past, a shift of more than 1.5‰ would be enough to catch the attention of a researcher and make them wonder what could have happened.</p> <p>What is unusual about the 1.5‰ drop today in comparison to those observed in the geological record is how rapidly it is happening. It is more common to see such changes happen over millions of years, not hundreds of years. The rate at which atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> δ<sup>13</sup>C is dropping is approximately 10 times faster than the carbon-isotope shift at the PETM, which is the fastest event ever documented in the rock record.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere mixes into the oceans, where organisms take up carbonate ions to make calcium carbonate shells. The 1.5‰ drop has been imprinted in the calcium carbonate of marine organisms like sponges (Böhm et al, 2002), and will remain in the rock record globally, as evidence of human activity. Because of this, and because of many other such markers that are being left in the rock record by human activities (the presence of plastic, for example), some have suggested that it is time to define a new division of geological time, the <strong>Anthropocene Epoch</strong>. The start of the Anthropocene Epoch would mark the point at which human activities became evident in the geological record.</p> <h3>Radioactive Carbon (14-Carbon)</h3> <p>Carbon-14 dating relies on the fact that <sup>14</sup>C decays to <sup>14</sup>N at a known rate. By knowing the rate, and how much <sup>14</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>N are present, we can work out how long the decay has been happening. Knowledge of the decay rate of <sup>14</sup>C also makes it useful to track fossil fuel additions to the atmosphere.</p> <p>The rate of decay of a radioactive isotope is expressed as a <strong>half-life</strong>, which in this case is the amount of time it would take half of the <sup>14</sup>C atoms in a sample to decay to <sup>14</sup>N. The half-life of <sup>14</sup>C is 5,730 years. After 10 half-lives, or 57,300 years, there isn’t enough <sup>14</sup>C left to do an age measurement. Fossil fuels are millions to hundreds of millions of years old, long enough for there to be none of the <sup>14</sup>C originally contained by the plant material.</p> <p>There is a notation system for <sup>14</sup>C similar to the δ<sup>13</sup>C notation system for the ratio of <sup>13</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C, in which the amount of <sup>14</sup>C is compared to a standard. Carbon-14 amounts are reported as Δ<sup>14</sup>C values in units of ‰. In that system, the atmosphere as a whole had a Δ<sup>14</sup>C of 45‰ in 2010, and fossil fuels have a Δ<sup>14</sup>C of -1000‰. Effectively, the atmosphere appears to be aging rapidly. In the bathtub analogy for carbon isotopes, adding CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels is like dumping ice into the tub.</p> <p>The effects of fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> on atmospheric Δ<sup>14</sup>C levels must account for <sup>14</sup>C being made through natural processes in the atmosphere, and decaying away; for the decay of a large pulse of <sup>14</sup>C created by nuclear bomb tests; and for other sources of carbon with very low Δ<sup>14</sup>C values. Fortunately for scientists tracking fossil fuels by their impact on atmospheric Δ<sup>14</sup>C, the contribution of low Δ<sup>14</sup>C CO<sub>2</sub> from other sources is tiny compared to known rates of fossil fuel emissions, and the other quantities are also well known. Thus, they have been able to determine a decrease in Δ<sup>14</sup>C of 3‰ for every 1 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> added from fossil fuels.</p> <h1>The Carbon Cycle and Change in Today&#8217;s Earth System</h1> <p>Change in the Earth system is strongly driven by Earth’s carbon cycle, the interrelated materials and processes that change carbon from one form to another, and move it from one reservoir to another (Figure 16.33). The CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is just one part of the carbon cycle. Carbon in the atmosphere is taken in by marine and terrestrial plants, and released when they are decomposed. Microbial activities in the soil and respiration by plants release carbon. Carbon also moves into and out of the ocean through exchange processes at the ocean’s surface.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2559" style="width: 593px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2559" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle-1024x863.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="500" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle-1024x863.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle-300x253.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle-768x647.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle-65x55.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle-225x190.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Carbon_cycle-350x295.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.33</strong> Flows of carbon in the Earth system.

The remaining 4 billion tons accumulates in the atmosphere each year because the Earth system does not presently have the capacity to remove it.</p> <p>The fossil fuels added by humans are particularly problematic because burning them means releasing hundreds of millions of years worth of plant-stored carbon that would otherwise not have been an active part of the carbon cycle today. Contrast this with cutting down a tree and burning the wood. Burning the wood also releases CO<sub>2</sub> from carbon that was stored in plant tissues, but the difference is in timescale and quantity. If a tree grows for 50 years before it is used as fuel, then over a century there is effectively no change in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. What carbon the tree took out of the atmosphere decades before, burning and decomposition have returned.</p> <p>For fossil fuels, on the other hand, the carbon was removed from the atmosphere tens or even hundreds of millions of years ago. Trees draw down CO<sub>2</sub> before we burn them, balancing out the equation, but with fossil fuels <em>there is no initial draw-down from our present atmosphere</em>. Releasing the carbon stored in those fuels results in a net addition to the atmosphere. What makes this even worse is that because fossil fuels have been accumulating for so long, there is an enormous quantity that can be burned. Trees can only be burned as fast as they replace themselves, but with fossil fuels it is like accumulating trees for millions of years, then burning them all at once.</p> <h1>Signals of Present-Day Earth-System Change</h1> <h2>Rising Temperatures</h2> <p>From studies of Earth&#8217;s past climate history, it is clear what to expect as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise. Climate warming is one outcome. We know from ice core records that global average temperatures are warmer now than they have been for most of the last 800,000 years (<a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/CO2-temp-800k.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figure 16.22</a>). Over the shorter term, direct measurements show that the climate has been on a warming trend after the start of the Industrial Revolution (<a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/sunspot_data.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figure 16.9</a>). Proxy data making up a revised version of the &#8220;hockey stick&#8221; diagram—so named because the shape reminded some people of a hockey stick laying on its side—take the record back to 1000 years ago, and show global average temperatures falling until the onset of the industrial era (Figure 16.35).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2565" style="width: 686px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2.png"><img class="wp-image-2565" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2-1024x657.png" alt="" width="686" height="440" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2-1024x657.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2-300x193.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2-768x493.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2-65x42.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2-225x144.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/Hockey_stick_annotated-2-350x225.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.35</strong> Global average temperature change for the last 1000 years.

According to satellite data, the average rate of change since 1993 has been a rise of approximately 3 mm per year. Part of the rise is due to the expansion of seawater as it warms. Another part of the rise is from water added by melting glaciers and other year-round land-based snow and ice. Note that melting of sea ice—ice already floating in the ocean—does not contribute directly to sea-level rise because the ice is already floating in the ocean.</p> <p>Based on how much melting has occurred thus far, sea levels are projected to rise to between 47 cm and 130 cm above 1880 levels (Figure 16.36). However, there is some uncertainty about how melting rates will respond to changes in the Earth system that result from climate change, such as changes in currents, or seawater beneath the leading edge of melting ice sheets warming the ice from beneath. With that uncertainty factored in, sea level rise could be as low as 33 cm above 1880 levels, or more than 2 m higher.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2574" style="width: 704px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2574"><img class="wp-image-2574" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change-1024x704.png" alt="" width="704" height="484" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change-1024x704.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change-300x206.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change-768x528.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change-65x45.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change-225x155.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change-350x240.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-sea-level-change.png 1080w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.36</strong> Measured and projected change in global average sea level.

Where ocean waters experience more warming, and thus more thermal expansion, sea level rise may be greater than elsewhere. Regions that are rebounding as ice melts could experience less sea level rise, or even a fall in sea level, because the elevation of the terrain is actually increasing over time. On the other hand, regions on the peripheral bulge around the margins of ice sheets could experience greater than average sea level rise because the terrain will subside at the same time that the oceans are gaining volume.</p> <p>Areas that become flooded could experience greater than average sea level rise, because the weight of water causes the land to subside further. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in September of 2017, measurements were reported that showed subsidence of up to 1.5 cm in the region of Houston, Texas. In this case, some of the subsidence could have been from sediments being compressed under the weight of flood waters, however the weight of water, like the weight of ice, does cause the crust to float lower in the mantle.</p> <h2>Melting Ice Sheets</h2> <p>Keeping track of how rapidly ice sheets are melting is important both for being able to predict future sea level change, and for knowing in general how rapidly the Earth system is changing. In a recent study, Bamber et al. (2018) analyzed satellite measurements to determine how much mass had been lost from the Antarctic ice sheets, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and from other glaciers and ice caps around the world since 1992 (Figure 16.37).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2583" style="width: 605px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2583" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr-1024x652.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="385" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr-1024x652.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr-300x191.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr-768x489.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr-65x41.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr-225x143.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr-350x223.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/erlaac2f0f1_hr.jpg 1504w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.37</strong> Large ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland (blue) and glaciers and ice caps (yellow). Circles are proportional to the area of each region that is covered by glaciers. The green part of the circle indicates the proportion of the ice with margins resting on land, and the blue part indicates margins in the ocean. This difference is important in part because of the potential for faster melting when the base of an ice sheet is in contact with warming seawater. <em>Source: Bamber et al.

The exception is the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which actually showed an increase in mass during the studied interval. This is because snowfall has increased in the East Antarctic, to the point where more snow is falling now than at any time in the past 2000 years (Medley et al., 2017). The East Antarctic is warming just as the West is, but the difference is that the winds that preferentially bring precipitation to the East rather than the West can carry more moisture because the air is warmer.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2587" style="width: 602px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution.png"><img class="wp-image-2587" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution.png" alt="" width="602" height="412" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution.png 835w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution-300x205.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution-768x525.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution-65x44.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution-225x154.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/ice-melt-contribution-350x239.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.38</strong> Results of a study of the change in mass of ice on Earth&#8217;s surface.

What this means in practical terms is that humans today are experiencing the results of past human influence on the Earth system, and humans in the future will experience the results of decisions made today.</p> <h1>Data on Key Sources of Radiative Forcing</h1> <p>The <strong>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</strong> (IPCC) was established by the United Nations in 1988 to help with those decisions. Is responsible for reviewing the scientific literature on climate change and issuing periodic reports on several topics, including the scientific basis for understanding climate change, our vulnerability to observed and predicted climate changes, and what we can do to limit climate change and minimize its impacts.</p> <p>In their Fifth Assessment Report, Summary for Policy Makers, the IPCC identified the main contributions to heating or cooling our atmosphere, and the impact they had in 2011 compared to 1750, before the industrial age (Figure 16.39). The main natural source of radiative forcing is the sun, but it contributes relatively little compared to anthropogenic sources. The greatest contribution over all comes from anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> (top row). Note that the bar sizes indicate the relative contribution, and correspond to the scale at the bottom of the diagram. Bars to the left of the zero line indicate cooling of the atmosphere, and bars to the right indicate warming. The column on the far right indicates how confident scientists are in their assessment of radiative forcing for each source (VH = very high; H = high; M = medium; L = low).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2594" style="width: 700px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2594"><img class="wp-image-2594" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05-1024x872.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="596" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05-1024x872.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05-300x256.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05-768x654.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05-65x55.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05-225x192.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05-350x298.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/FigSPM-05.jpg 1296w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.39</strong> Anthropogenic and natural contributions to radiative forcing in 2011 compared to 1750. <em>Source: IPCC (2013) <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View source (SPM.5, p. 14).</a> Click the image for terms of use.</em></div></div> <p>The biggest anthropogenic contributor to warming, CO<sub>2</sub>, accounts for 50% of positive forcing. CH<sub>4</sub> and its atmospheric derivatives (CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and O<sub>3</sub>) account for 29%, and the halocarbon gases (mostly leaked from air-conditioning appliances) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O, from burning fossils fuels) account for 5% each. Carbon monoxide (CO, also produced by burning fossil fuels) accounts for 7%, and the volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC) account for 3%.</p> <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions come mostly from coal- and gas-fired power stations, motorized vehicles (cars, trucks, and aircraft), and industrial operations (e.g., smelting), and indirectly from forestry. CH<sub>4</sub> emissions come from production of fossil fuels (escape from coal mining and from gas and oil production), livestock farming (mostly beef), landfills, and wetland rice farming. N<sub>2</sub>O and CO come mostly from the combustion of fossil fuels. In summary, close to 70% of current anthropogenic GHG emissions come from fossil fuel production and use, while most of the rest comes from agriculture and landfills.</p> <h1>Projected Warming</h1> <p>The IPCC projects future warming by using scenarios that represent different possible paths that take into account global population, economic development, and global co-operation. In their best-case scenario, called RCP2.6 (RCP stands for representative concentration pathway, and 2.6 refers to a radiative forcing of 2.6 W/m<sup>2</sup>), global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions begin to decline after 2020, and go to zero by 2080. Their worst-case scenario is RCP8.5, in which global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions continue to rise rapidly. Intermediate scenarios reflect cases where global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions eventually peak, but do not go to zero.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2599" style="width: 606px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming.png"><img class="wp-image-2599" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming.png" alt="" width="606" height="596" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming.png 950w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming-300x295.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming-768x755.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming-65x64.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming-225x221.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/projected-warming-350x344.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.40</strong> Model projections to 2100 for surface temperatures (a) and the extent of sea ice in September in the Northern Hemisphere (b).

Temperatures soared to over 40°C, as much as 12°C above normal over a wide area, and wildfires raged in many parts of the country. Over 55,000 deaths are attributed to the heat and to respiratory problems associated with the fires (Figure 16.42).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2616" style="width: 576px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Temperature-anomalies-across-Russia-1024x590.png"><img class="wp-image-2616 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/russia_anomaly_small.png" alt="" width="576" height="324" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/russia_anomaly_small.png 576w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/russia_anomaly_small-300x169.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/russia_anomaly_small-65x37.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/russia_anomaly_small-225x127.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/russia_anomaly_small-350x197.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.42</strong> Temperature anomalies across Russia and neighbouring regions during July 2010. <em>Source: Earth Observatory (2010) Public Domain <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/45069/heatwave-in-russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>A clue to explaining the heatwave was simultaneous flooding in Pakistan: in July, rainfalls were 70% higher than normal, and in August rainfalls were 102% above normal. Flooding from heavy rains combined with a burst dam impacted 18 million people, killing 1,985. These events were linked by a change in atmospheric circulation that caused weather patterns to stall out over Russia and Pakistan. The change itself was due in part to a decrease in the temperature differences between high and low latitudes, caused by warming in the north.</p> <h1>Sea-Level Rise and Tropical Storm Impacts</h1> <p>Projections for sea-level rise to the end of this century vary widely (Figure 16.36), however it is already the case that low-lying coastal regions are experiencing increased flooding during storm events. Flood defenses designed decades ago are or will soon be insufficient in the face of increasingly frequent and more extreme storm events. In a 2008 report, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that by 2070 approximately 150 million people living in coastal areas could be at risk of flooding due to the combined effects of sea-level rise, increased storm intensity, and land subsidence. The assets at risk (buildings, roads, bridges, ports, etc.) are on the order of $35 trillion ($35,000,000,000,000). Countries with the greatest exposure of population to flooding are China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, U.S.A., Japan, and Thailand. Some of the major cities at risk include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Mumbai, Kolkata, Dhaka, Ho Chi Minh City, Tokyo, Miami, and New York.</p> <p>One of the other risks for coastal populations, besides sea-level rise, is that climate warming is also associated with an increase in the intensity of tropical storms (e.g., hurricanes or typhoons), which almost always bring serious flooding from intense rain and storm surges. It is difficult for climatologists to ascribe all of the characteristics of a particular tropical storm to climate change, but it is much easier to make a case for why tropical storms in general would become stronger, and have more of an impact on coastal regions.</p> <p>When Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey and New York in 2012 (Figure 16.43), it had a devastating impact in part because it smashed into the coast directly rather than moving parallel to the coast. There was some speculation that the unusual path was the result of changes in atmospheric circulation that were related to climate change. We can&#8217;t say for certain whether climate change caused Sandy to move the way it did, but we can say with confidence that climate change worsened the impact of Sandy through sea-level rise. Consider that, over the previous 100 years, sea level had risen a foot at the southern-most tip of Manhattan Island. The island was hit by a 14-foot storm-surge, higher than it would have been without sea-level rise.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2622" style="width: 605px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2622" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="403" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island-300x200.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island-768x512.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island-65x43.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island-225x150.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island-350x233.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/08/1280px-Hurricane_Sandy_damage_Long_Beach_Island.jpg 1280w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.43</strong> Damage from Hurricane Sandy on the coast of New Jersey. <em>Source: Master Sgt.

The same is true in Alaska, Russia, and Scandinavia. One problem that northern communities are currently dealing with is that thawing permafrost is weakening sediments that were previously solid and stable. This can cause structures to settle, or even to sustain serious damage. Another problem with the weakening that occurs when permafrost thaws is that mass wasting can occur (Figure 16.46). This is particularly dangerous for northern communities along coastlines, where homes may be near the shore and the slopes beneath them further weakened by strong wave action during severe storms.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_543" style="width: 608px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591.jpg"><img class="wp-image-543" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591-1024x591.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="351" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591-300x173.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591-768x443.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591-65x38.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591-225x130.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591-350x202.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.46</strong> A degrading permafrost site on the north coast of Alaska. <em>Source: Alaska Science Center, U.

The amount of these greenhouse gases released by decomposing organic matter could be enough to generate a significant positive feedback, accelerating warming further. In some polar regions, including northern Canada, permafrost also includes methane hydrate, a highly concentrated form of CH<sub>4</sub> trapped in solid form. Breakdown of permafrost releases this CH<sub>4</sub> as well.</p> <h1>Pests and Disease</h1> <p>The geographical ranges of diseases and pests, especially those caused or transmitted by insects, have been shown to extend toward temperate regions because of climate change. West Nile virus and Lyme disease are two examples that already directly affect Canadians, while dengue fever could be an issue in the future. Canadians are also indirectly affected by the increase in populations of pests such as the mountain pine beetle (Figure 16.47).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765.jpg"><img class="wp-image-556" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765-1024x765.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="448" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765-300x224.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765-768x574.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765-65x49.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765-225x168.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Mountain-pine-beetle-damage-1024x765-350x261.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 16.47</strong> Mountain pine beetle damage in Manning Park, British Columbia. <em>Source: Jonhall (2010) CC BY 3.0 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pine_Beetle_in_Manning_Park.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <h4>References</h4> <p class="hanging-indent">Berwyn, B.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-16-summary-3" title="Chapter 16 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">113</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 16 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>16.1 What Is the Earth System?</h3> <p>Viewing Earth as a system allows us to take into account the complex ways in which the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere interact. Positive feedbacks amplify changes in the Earth system, and negative feedbacks reduce them. The stability of the Earth system will depend on what feedbacks are available. The presence of ice sheets makes the Earth system less stable.</p> <h3>16.2 Causes of Climate Change</h3> <p>Weather describes day-to-day conditions, but climate refers to the long-term average conditions over decades or longer. Climate forcings alter climate. They include processes that change the rate and location of solar energy reaching Earth’s surface; processes that alter how ocean currents move heat around Earth’s surface; and processes that affect how heat moves into and out of the atmosphere. Climate forcings operate on a range of timescales, from billions of years to less than a decade. Changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and albedo are two climate forcings affected by human activities.</p> <h3>16.3 Methods for Studying Past Climate</h3> <p>Climate conditions for some of human history can be determined from direct measurements that have been recorded, but for studying paleoclimate it is often necessary to use proxy data. Proxy data come from natural materials that behave in a systematic way in response to climate conditions like temperature or precipitation. Proxies include tree ring data, stable isotopes, measurements of gas bubbles trapped in ice, and the geographic distribution of rocks and fossils.</p> <h3>16.4 Computer Models of the Earth System</h3> <p>Earth-system models use mathematical equations to simulate Earth-system processes. Models are set up and checked using real-life measurements. Model uncertainty is a number that tells us the likelihood that a particular model result falls within a certain range of values. It is a way to evaluate whether results can be used to draw meaningful conclusions.</p> <h3>16.5 Humans in the Earth System</h3> <p>Data show recognizable anthropogenic influence on the Earth system beginning when humans began to use fossil fuels for industrial purposes. CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has the isotopic fingerprints of fossil fuels. The flow of anthropogenic carbon into the Earth system is relatively small compared to some natural flows, but natural processes do not remove all of what humans put in, causing CO<sub>2</sub> to accumulate in the atmosphere.</p> <h3>16.6 Welcome to the Anthropocene</h3> <p>Humans today are experiencing the results of past human influence on the Earth system, and humans in the future will experience the results of decisions made today. The main source of radiative forcing is anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>. Humans are already experiencing extreme climate events related to warming. The best-case projected warming scenario will stabilize global average temperatures at ~1ºC above 1996 temperatures by the end of the century, but this will require a peak in anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2020, and an end to anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2080.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>If you receive positive feedback on a project, this means someone says you did a good job. Does this mean a positive feedback in the climate system is also something good? Explain.</li> <li>Why does the presence of ice sheets cause the Earth system to be less stable?</li> <li>Using the orbital information on eccentricity, tilt, and precession, we could calculate variations in insolation for any latitude on Earth and for any month of the year. Why do we focus on a latitude of 65° N?</li> <li>Explain how the positioning of Gondwana at the South Pole contributed to glaciation during the Paleozoic.</li> <li>If the major currents in the oceans were to slow down or stop, how would that affect the distribution of heat on Earth, and what effect might that have on glaciation?</li> <li>Most volcanic eruptions lead to short-term cooling, but long-term sustained volcanism can lead to warming. Describe the mechanisms for these two different consequences.</li> <li>What property of greenhouse gases allows them to absorb infrared radiation and thus trap heat within the atmosphere?</li> <li>What are the advantages of proxy data over direct measurements of climate? What are the disadvantages of using proxy data?</li> <li>What are some steps that scientists take to help ensure that meaningful conclusions can be drawn from Earth-system computer models?</li> <li>What evidence tells us that rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels are primarily the result of humans burning fossil fuels?</li> <li>The flows of carbon through the carbon cycle that are related to human activities are actually much smaller than some natural flows. Why do human activities have such a large impact on the carbon cycle?</li> <li>Some people argue that climate has always changed, and present-day climate change is not significant compared to the long-term record of Earth&#8217;s climate. Is it true that present-day climate signals show that changes are not significant compared to Earth&#8217;s long-term climate history? Explain your answer.</li> <li>What climate mechanism links both extreme heat waves and droughts, and extreme flooding and rainfall events to climate change?</li> <li>What evidence suggests that increasingly intense tropical storms can be expected as climate warms?</li> <li>What are the potential impacts of thawing permafrost?</li> </ol> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-answers-to-chapter-16-review-questions" title="Answers to Chapter 16 Review Questions"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">114</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Answers to Chapter 16 Review Questions</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>1. A positive feedback does not mean that something good is happening in the Earth system. Rather, it means that a change is being amplified by other Earth-system processes that were triggered by the change. From a human perspective, having a change amplified could be good or bad.</p> <p>2. When ice is present, relatively small changes in temperature can trigger albedo feedbacks that amplify the change. If no ice is present, a small increase in temperature might not have much of an impact. But if ice is present, that small increase could be enough to cause the ice to melt, and decrease Earth&#8217;s albedo. If ice is created when the climate cools, further cooling can be triggered if the ice increases Earth&#8217;s albedo significantly.</p> <p>3. We use 65° for estimating the glaciation potential of orbital variations because glaciers are most likely to form at high latitudes, where temperatures are cooler, and insolation less direct. We use 65° N rather than 65° S because for more than 50 million years the continents have been concentrated in the northern hemisphere. We use July instead of January, because for ice to form and remain year-round, it is necessary to have cool summers.</p> <p>4. Gondwana was situated over the south pole for much of the Paleozoic. Not only was the land subject to temperatures cooler over all, and less direct insolation for part of the year, but the large size of the continent limited the extent to which heat from the ocean could reach the interior of the continent. The development of ice on Gondwana further cooled the planet through albedo feedback.</p> <p>5. If the major currents in the oceans were to slow down or stop, the tropics would get hotter and the high-latitude areas would get colder, leading to expansion of glaciers and sea ice. The various feedbacks (e.g., higher albedo because of increased ice cover) would result in a cooler climate over all.</p> <p>6. From a climate perspective, the two important volcanic gases are SO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. SO<sub>2</sub> is converted to aerosols which block sunlight and can lead to short-term cooling (lasting years). CO<sub>2</sub> can lead to warming, but only in situations where there is an elevated level of volcanism over the long term.</p> <p>7. Greenhouse gases vibrate at frequencies that are similar to those of infrared radiation. When infrared radiation hits a greenhouse gas molecule, the molecule’s vibrational energy is enhanced and the radiation energy is converted into heat, which is trapped within the atmosphere.</p> <p>8. Proxy data can provide information about climate in the distant past, for times during which there were no direct measurements. As new techniques are developed, analyses of proxy data can improve, whereas direct measurements will have experimental errors related to the instruments used to make them at the time. A disadvantage of proxy data is that we don&#8217;t always have a detailed timeline to go with the data, and may need to rely on other lines of evidence to understand when the proxy data should apply. Special equipment or techniques may be needed to get proxy data from geological materials. It is also necessary to ensure that geological processes have not altered the materials in some way that makes the results of analyses unreliable.</p> <p>9. Real-life measurements are used to set up the model, and to test that it can provide realistic results. Many different models may be used to study the same scenario, and the results compared. This helps scientists to compare the results of representing the Earth system in different ways. An estimate of uncertainty is provided so scientists can decide whether or not the range of uncertainty is too big, given the size of the Earth-system change being studied.</p> <p>10. Data from ice cores and direct measurements show that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels began to rise very rapidly at the same time that humans began using fossil fuels extensively to power activities like manufacturing and transportation. At the same time, the stable carbon-isotope composition of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> began to decrease at a rate that is consistent with the stable carbon-isotope fingerprint of plant-derived organic matter. Also simultaneously, the radiocarbon age of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> began to fall, consistent with carbon from very ancient plant sources being added to the atmosphere. Aside from the timing of geochemical changes matching the onset of the industrial era, there are no other sources of carbon that can account for the geochemical fingerprint in the atmosphere.</p> <p>11. The reason that relatively small anthropogenic flows of carbon into the carbon cycle can have a big impact is that they aren&#8217;t being balanced by natural processes that can remove the extra carbon. The result is that carbon from anthropogenic activities is accumulating in the atmosphere and ocean.</p> <p>12. In the past, Earth&#8217;s climate has been both much colder and much hotter than today. However, present day temperatures are significantly different compared to global average temperatures over the past 1000 years, and stand out in the data from the past 800,000 years. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels are much higher than at any time during the past 800,000 years, and on that timescale, the increase is almost instantaneous. Therefore, the magnitude of present-day change in the Earth-system stands out clearly from background conditions predating the appearance of anatomically modern humans. It is also happening much faster than even the most rapid carbon-release event that we know of in the rock record.</p> <p>13. Climate warming happens more rapidly at high latitudes more than low latitudes, decreasing the temperature difference between them. The decreased difference allows atmospheric circulation patterns to &#8220;stall out&#8221; over a location for longer than usual. What would normally be a short heatwave lasts much longer, and a precipitation event that would normally move elsewhere after a short time is now halted in place for weeks.</p> <p>14. See Figure 16.44. The power of tropical storms depends on the warmth of seawater. Data show that during particularly warm intervals, tropical storms are stronger. Data also show that the strength of storms over all is increasing as sea surface temperatures rise over time.</p> <p>15. Frozen soils provide a solid foundation for buildings in northern communities. Melting of permafrost means the soil beneath buildings is weakened, and buildings can suffer structural damage. Thawing means that hillsides are more prone to mass wasting, especially terrain along coasts. In terms of the climate system, thawing of permafrost allows micro-organisms to decompose organic matter within previously-frozen sediments, releasing additional CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, and contributing to a positive feedback.</p> </div></div>

They are at least tens of metres thick and at least hundreds of metres in extent. About 10% of Earth’s land surface is currently covered with glacial ice, and although the vast majority of this is in Antarctica and Greenland, there are many glaciers in Canada, especially in the mountainous parts of BC, Alberta, and the Yukon, and in the far north (Figure 17.1). At various times during the past million years, glacial ice has been much more extensive, covering at least 30% of the Earth’s land surface at times.</p> <p>Glaciers currently represent the largest repository of fresh water on Earth (~69% of all fresh water). They are highly sensitive to changes in climate, and in recent decades have been melting rapidly worldwide (Figure 17.2). Although some of the larger glacial masses may still last for several centuries, smaller glaciers, including many in western Canada, may be gone within decades. For mountainous regions, glaciers are an important sources of drinking water. Rapid glacial melting is a troubling issue for western Canadians because glacial ice is an important part of the hydrologic cycle in glaciated regions. Irrigation systems in BC, and across Alberta and Saskatchewan, are replenished by meltwater originating from glaciers in the Coast Range and the Rocky Mountains.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1638" style="width: 550px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1638" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it-1024x830.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="446" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it-300x243.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it-768x623.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it-65x53.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it-225x182.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/now-you-see-it-350x284.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.2</strong> Example of rapid melting of a glacier over a 63-year period.

Latitude, topography, and global and regional climate patterns are important controls on the distribution and size of these glaciers.</p> <h1>Continental Glaciers</h1> <p><strong>Continental glaciers</strong> cover vast areas of land. Today, continental glaciers are only present in extreme polar regions: Antarctica and Greenland (Figure 17.3). Historically, continental glaciers also covered large regions of Canada Europe, and Asia, and they are responsible for many distinctive topographic features in these regions (Section 17.2 and 17.3).</p> <p>Continent glaciers can form and grow when climate conditions in a region cool over extended periods of time. Snow can build up over time in regions that do not warm up seasonally, and if the snow accumulates in vast amounts, it can compact under its own weight and form ice.</p> <p>Earth’s two current continental glaciers, the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets, comprise about 99% of Earth’s glacial ice, and approximately 68% of Earth’s fresh water. The Antarctic Ice Sheet is vastly larger than the Greenland Ice Sheet (Figure 17.4) and contains about 17 times as much ice. If the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet melted, sea level would rise by about 80 m and most of Earth’s major coastal cities would be submerged.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1642" style="width: 669px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2-1024x436.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1642" width="669" height="285" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2-1024x436.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2-300x128.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2-768x327.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2-65x28.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2-225x96.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2-350x149.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/antarctic-greenland-2.png 1230w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.4</strong> Simplified cross-section profiles of the Antarctic and Greenland continental ice sheets.

Continental glacier ice flows from the region where it is thickest toward the edges where it is thinner (Figure 17.5). In the central thickest parts, the ice flows almost vertically down toward the base, while at the edges of the glacier, it flows horizontally out toward the margins. In continental glaciers like the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets, the thickest parts (4,000 m and 3,000 m thick, respectively) are the areas where the rate of snowfall, and therefore of ice accumulation, are greatest. In Antarctica, the ice sheet flows out over the ocean, forming ice shelves. Ice shelves can slow the flow of continental glaciers outward. Conversely, if ice shelves break down continental glacier flow can speed up.</span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_571" style="width: 624px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Ice-Sheet.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Ice-Sheet.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-571" width="624" height="181" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Ice-Sheet.png 624w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Ice-Sheet-300x87.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Ice-Sheet-65x19.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Ice-Sheet-225x65.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Ice-Sheet-350x102.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.5</strong> Cross-section showing ice-flow in the Antarctic Ice Sheet. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/antarctic-flow-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <h1>Alpine Glaciers</h1> <p><strong>Alpine glaciers</strong> (aka valley glaciers) originate high up in the mountains, mostly in temperate and polar regions (Figure 17.1), but also in tropical regions in high mountains (e.g. in the Andes Mountains of South America).</p> <p>The flow of alpine glaciers is driven by gravity, and primarily controlled by the slope of the ice surface (Figure 17.6).

Stress also affects how ice deforms; at high stress ice will either break or deform plastically (ductile deformation) depending on the pressure conditions. Under brittle deformation conditions (low pressures, shallow depths in the glacier), stress is released when the ice cracks, so does not build up to high values. Within the upper 50 &#8211; 100 m of ice (above the dashed red line, in Figure 17.9), flow is brittle: the ice is rigid and will crack in response to stress.   Under ductile deformation conditions (higher pressures deeper in the glacier), stress can accumulate, and the ice will flow plastically in response to that stress. Ice deforms plastically if deeper than about 100 m in the glacier, and in this region stress levels can accumulate to high values (100 kilopascals or greater, Figure 17.9).</p> <p>When the lower ice of a glacier flows, it moves the upper ice along with it. It may seem from the stress patterns (red numbers and arrows in Figure 17.9) that the lower ice moves more or faster than the upper ice, but this is not the case. The lower ice deforms (flows) and the upper part is carried along and deforms through brittle deformation if subjected to sufficient stress. The upper part of the glacier moves faster than the base of the glacier because there is friction between the base of the glacier and the surface beneath it that slows the movement of the ice at the base.</p> <p>The plastic lower ice of a glacier can flow over irregularities in the rocks under the glacier. However, the upper rigid ice cannot flow in this way, and because it is being carried along by the lower ice, it tends to crack in locations when the lower ice flows over changes in the topography below the glacier. This leads to formation of <strong>crevasses</strong> in areas where the rate of flow of the deeper, plastic ice is changing. In the area shown in Figure 17.10, for example, the glacier is accelerating over the steep terrain, and the rigid surface ice cracks to release stress that accumulates due to the change in velocity and tension in the ice.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1650" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red-1024x757.jpg" alt="" class="size-large wp-image-1650" width="1024" height="757" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red-1024x757.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red-300x222.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red-768x567.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red-65x48.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red-225x166.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red-350x259.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Spragg_Mt_Cook_red.jpg 1080w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure</strong> <strong>17.10</strong> Crevasses in a glacier in Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand. <em>Source: Bernard Spragg (2008) CC0 1.0 </em><em><a href="https://flic.kr/p/dn5m8C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>In addition to deformation, another important aspect of glacier flow is <strong>basal sliding</strong>, which is sliding movement between the base of the glacier and the underlying material.

Friction between the base of the glacier and the surface underneath generates heat and can lead to melting of the ice at the base of the glacier. Rainwater and meltwater from upper regions of the glacier can percolate down and transfer heat to warm the base of the glacier and enhance basal sliding, particularly in warmer seasons. Geothermal heat from below also contributes to melting at the base of glaciers in regions with high heat flow due to volcanic activity. </span></p> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Another factor that controls the temperature at the base of a glacier is the thickness of the ice. The force of gravity acting on thicker ice can enhance friction and melting at the base. Ice is also a good insulator so can prevent accumulated heat from escaping. The leading edge of an alpine glacier is typically relatively thin (see Figure 17.9), so it is common for this part to be frozen to its base while the rest of the glacier is still sliding. Since the leading edge of the glacier is frozen to the ground, and the rest of the glacier behind continues to slide forward, this causes the trailing ice to be pushed (or thrust) over top of the leading edge, forming thrust faults in the ice (Figure 17.12).</span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1654" style="width: 561px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1654" width="561" height="421" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier-300x225.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier-768x576.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier-65x49.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier-225x169.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Zackowitz_Byron_Glacier-350x263.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.12</strong> Thrust faults at the leading edge of the Byron Glacier, Portage Lake, Alaska, USA.

The ice itself is not particularly effective at erosion because it is relatively soft (Mohs hardness 1.5 at 0°C). Glacial erosion is primarily driven by abrasion of the underlying rocks by rock fragments embedded within the ice. These rocks are pushed down onto the underlying surfaces by the ice, and because they are hard they can gouge and grind down the materials beneath the glacier. An analogy for these processes is to compare the effect of a regular piece of paper being rubbed against a wooden surface (“ice eroding rock”) to rubbing a piece of sandpaper over the same surface (“ice with embedded rocks eroding rock”). The results of glacial erosion are different in areas with continental glaciation versus alpine glaciation.</p> <h1>Continental Glacial Erosion Features</h1> <p>Continental glaciation tends to produce relatively flat bedrock surfaces, especially where the rock beneath is uniform in strength. In areas where there are differences in the strength of rocks, a glacier tends to erode the softer and weaker rock more effectively than the harder and stronger rock. Much of central and eastern Canada, which was completely covered by the huge Laurentide Ice Sheet at various times during the Pleistocene Epoch, has been eroded to a relatively flat surface. Glacial deposits have created distinctive topographic features on the landscapes in these regions — such as drumlins, eskers, and moraines (Figure 17.16). These continental glacial features are deposits of glacial materials and are described further in Section 17.3.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1662" style="width: 442px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-1662" width="442" height="214" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB.png 442w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB-300x145.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB-65x31.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB-225x109.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB-350x169.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.16</strong> Landscape features associated with continental glaciation <em>Source: Luis María Benítez (2005) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Receding_glacier_landscape_LMB.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>In areas of continental glaciation, the lithosphere is depressed by the weight of glacial ice that is up to 4,000 m thick. Basins formed along the edges of continental glaciers; for example, basins formed around the edges of the Laurentide Ice Sheet that once covered much of Canada (Section 17.4). These basins filled with glacial meltwater, and layers of sediments. Many such lakes, some of them huge, existed at various times along the southern edge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.</p> <p>One example of these lakes was Glacial Lake Missoula, which formed within Idaho and Montana, just south of the BC border with the United States. During the latter part of the last glaciation (30 ka to 15 ka), the ice holding back Lake Missoula retreated enough to allow some of the lake water to escape, which escalated into a voluminous and rapid outflow (over days to weeks). During this outflow, most of the lake drained into the Columbia River valley and flowed to the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that this type of catastrophic outflow happened at least 25 times during this period, and in many cases, the rate of outflow was equivalent to the discharge of all of Earth’s current rivers combined.</p> <h1>Alpine Glacial Erosion Features</h1> <p>Alpine glaciers produce very different topography than continental glaciers. Alpine glaciers produce wide valleys with relatively flat bottoms and steep sides due to the erosion that occurs at the base and edges of the glaciers. These are known as <strong>U-shaped valleys</strong> (Figure 17.17). In contrast, unglaciated river valleys generally have a V shape.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_584" style="width: 453px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/U-shaped-valley.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/U-shaped-valley.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-584" width="453" height="163" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/U-shaped-valley.png 453w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/U-shaped-valley-300x108.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/U-shaped-valley-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/U-shaped-valley-225x81.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/U-shaped-valley-350x126.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.17</strong> A depiction of a U-shaped valley occupied by a large glacier. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0 </em><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/u-valley-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>view source</em></a></div></div> <p>In coastal regions where the bottom of the valley is filled with water, the U-shaped valleys are called <strong>fjords</strong>.

Moraines, which are linear deposits of glacial sediments (till) left by the glacier along its edges, can form a dam at the end of a tarn. Often, a series of moraines will form as glaciers recede.

They are important sources of aggregate for construction materials (sand, gravel), and are also important groundwater reservoirs. Because they are almost all unconsolidated, they have significant implications for slope stability and mass wasting.</p> <p>Figure 17.26 illustrates some of the ways that sediments are transported and deposited by alpine glaciers. The Bering Glacier is the largest glacier in North America, and although most of it is in Alaska, it flows from an icefield that extends into the southwestern Yukon Territory. The surface of the ice is partially, or in some cases completely, covered with rocky debris that has fallen onto the glacier from surrounding steep rock faces. There are muddy rivers issuing from the glacier in several locations, depositing sediment on land, into Vitus Lake, and directly into the ocean. Icebergs are portions of the glacier that have broken off and float away in a lake or ocean. Icebergs are laden with glacial sediments, which are released and deposited as the icebergs melt. Also, not visible in this view, there are sediments being moved along within and beneath the glacier itself.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1686" style="width: 570px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg-1024x834.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1686" width="570" height="465" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg-1024x834.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg-300x244.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg-768x626.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg-65x53.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg-225x183.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg-350x285.jpg 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/bering_etm_2002272_lrg.jpg 1080w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.26</strong> Part of the Bering Glacier in southeast Alaska, the largest glacier in North America.

These sediments form <strong>lateral moraines</strong> (moraine deposits along the edges of the glacier, see Figure 17.1 for an example). Where two glaciers meet, the sediments form <strong>medial moraines</strong> (medial moraines are visible in Figure 17.20 and Figure 17.26.) Most of this material is deposited on the ground when the ice melts. This is called <strong>ablation till</strong>, a mixture of fine and coarse angular rock fragments, with much less sand, silt, and clay than lodgement till (Figure 17.28). When supraglacial sediments become incorporated into the body of the glacier, they are known as englacial sediments (Figure 17.27).</p> <p>Water flows on the surface, within, and at the base of a glacier, even in cold areas and even when the glacier is advancing. Depending upon its velocity, this water is able to transport sediments of various sizes, and discharges most of these sediments out of the lower end of the glacier, where they are deposited as <strong>outwash sediments</strong>. These sediments accumulate in a wide range of environments in the <strong>proglacial</strong> region (the area in front of a glacier). Most of the sediments accumulate in fluvial environments, but some are deposited in lacustrine and marine environments. <strong>Glaciofluvial sediments</strong> are similar to sediments deposited in normal fluvial environments, but are glacially-derived sediments, and are thus dominated by silt, sand, and gravel. The grains tend to be moderately well rounded and sorted, and the sediments have similar sedimentary structures (e.g., bedding, cross-bedding, clast imbrication [overlapping]) to those formed by non-glacial streams (Figure 17.29).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1693" style="width: 661px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1693" width="661" height="319" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2-300x145.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2-768x371.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2-65x31.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2-225x109.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gf-2-350x169.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.29</strong> Examples of glaciofluvial sediments: a: glaciofluvial cross-bedded sand of the Quadra Sand Formation at Comox, BC.; b: glaciofluvial gravel and sand, Nanaimo, BC. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0</em> <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/gf-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>view source</em></a></div></div> <p>A large proglacial plain of sediment is called a <strong>sandur</strong> (aka <strong>outwash plain</strong>)<strong>, </strong>and within this area, glaciofluvial deposits can be tens of metres thick.

Kettle lakes are also known as pothole lakes or prairie potholes.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1695" style="width: 742px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1695" width="742" height="282" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2-300x114.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2-768x292.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2-65x25.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2-225x85.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/kettle-2-350x133.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.30</strong> A kettle lake amid vineyards and orchards in the Osoyoos area of BC. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0</em> <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/kettle-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>view source</em></a></div></div> <p>A supraglacial, englacial, or subglacial stream will create its own channel within the ice, and sediments that are being transported and deposited by the stream will build up within that channel.

These are dominated by silt- and clay-sized particles and are typically laminated (finely layered) on the millimetre scale. In some cases, <strong>varves</strong> develop. Varves are a series of beds with distinctive summer and winter layers: relatively coarse in the summer when melt discharge is high, and finer in the winter, when discharge is low. Icebergs are common in proglacial lakes, and most of them contain englacial sediments of various sizes. As the icebergs melt, the released clasts sink to the bottom and are incorporated into the glaciolacustrine layers as <strong>drop stones</strong> (Figure 17.33a). The processes that occur in proglacial lakes can also take place where a glacier terminates in the ocean. The sediments deposited there are called <strong>glaciomarine sediments</strong> (Figure 17.33b).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1700" style="width: 660px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1700" width="660" height="317" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2.png 912w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2-300x144.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2-768x369.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2-65x31.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2-225x108.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/gl-gm-2-350x168.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.33</strong> Examples of glaciolacustrine and glaciomarine sedimentary structures. a: varved glaciolacustrine sediments containing a drop stone, Nanaimo, BC.; and b: a laminated glaciomarine sediment, Englishman River, BC. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2016) CC BY 4.0</em> <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/gl-gm-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>view source</em></a></div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercise: Identifying Glacial Depositional Environments</h3> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Refer to the photo of the Bering Glacier in Alaska shown in Figure 17.26.

Based on evidence of glacial deposits from the area around Lake Huron in Ontario and elsewhere, it is evident that the Huronian Glaciation lasted from approximately 2.4 to 2.1 Ga. Because rocks of that age are rare, we do not know much about the intensity or global extent of this glaciation.</p> <p>Late in the Proterozoic, for reasons that are not fully understood, the climate cooled dramatically, and Earth had the most intense time of glaciation it has ever experienced. The glaciations of the Cryogenian Period (<em>cryo</em> is Latin for icy cold) are also known as the “Snowball Earth” glaciations. Scientists have hypothesized that the entire planet was frozen at this time — even in equatorial regions — with ice on the oceans up to 1 km thick. A visitor to our planet at that time would not have found it habitable, although life still survived in the oceans.</p> <p>There were two main glacial periods within the Cryogenian, each lasting for about 20 million years: the Sturtian at around 700 Ma and the Marinoan at 650 Ma. There is also evidence of some shorter glaciations both before and after these longer periods of glaciation. The end of the Cryogenian glaciations coincides with the evolution of relatively large and complex life forms on Earth. This started during the Ediacaran Period, and then continued with the so-called explosion of life forms in the Cambrian. Some geologists think that the changing environmental conditions of the Cryogenian are what triggered the evolution of large and complex life.</p> <p>There have been three major glaciations during the Phanerozoic (the past 540 Ma). These include the Andean/Saharan (recorded in rocks of South America and Africa), the Karoo (named for rocks in southern Africa), and the Cenozoic glaciations. The Karoo was the longest of the Phanerozoic glaciations, persisting for much of the time that the supercontinent Gondwana was situated over the South Pole (~360 to 260 Ma). Glaciers covered large parts of Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica. This widespread glaciation, across continents that are now far apart, was an important component of Alfred Wegener’s evidence for continental drift. Unlike the Cryogenian glaciations, the Andean/Saharan, Karoo, and Cenozoic glaciations only affected parts of Earth. During Karoo times, for example, what is now North America was near the equator and remained unglaciated.</p> <p>Earth was warm and essentially unglaciated throughout the Mesozoic. Although there may have been some alpine glaciers at this time, there is no evidence for them preserved in the geologic record. The dinosaurs, which dominated terrestrial habitats during the Mesozoic, did not have to endure icy conditions.</p> <h1>Cenozoic Glaciations</h1> <p>A warm climate persisted into much of the Cenozoic; there is evidence that the Paleocene (from about 50 to 60 Ma) was the warmest part of the Phanerozoic since the Cambrian (Figure 17.35).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1710" style="width: 766px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1710" width="766" height="327" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends.png 864w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends-300x128.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends-768x328.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends-65x28.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends-225x96.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/03/Cenozoic_temp_trends-350x149.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.35</strong> Global temperature trends over the past 65 Ma (the Cenozoic).

For example, the collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate and the formation of the Himalayan range and the Tibetan Plateau. Mountain building events such as the formation of the Himalayas are followed by weathering and erosion of the uplifted rocks. Higher than normal global rates of silicate mineral weathering associated with mountain building, especially weathering of feldspar, leads to a decrease in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. This contributes to global climate cooling.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 283px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Circumpolar.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Circumpolar.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-564" width="283" height="279" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Circumpolar.png 283w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Circumpolar-65x64.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Antarctic-Circumpolar-225x222.png 225w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.36</strong> The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (red arrows) prevents warm water from the rest of Earth’s oceans from reaching Antarctica. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0</em> <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Antarctic-Circumpolar.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>view source</em></a></div></div> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">At 40 Ma, ongoing plate motion widened the narrow gap between South America and Antarctica, resulting in the opening of the Drake Passage. This allowed for unrestricted west-to-east flow of water around Antarctica: the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Figure 17.36), which effectively isolated the Southern Ocean from the warmer waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The region cooled significantly, and by 35 Ma (Oligocene) glaciers had started to form on Antarctica.</span></p> <p>Global temperatures remained relatively steady during the Oligocene and early Miocene, and the Antarctic glaciation waned during that time. At around 15 Ma, subduction-related volcanism between central and South America created the land connection between North and South America, preventing water from flowing between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This further restricted ocean currents that transfer heat from the tropics to the poles, leading to cooling and advance of the Antarctic glaciation.</p> <p>The expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet increased reflection of solar radiation at the Earth’s surface and promoted a positive feedback loop of further cooling. With more reflective glacial ice, there was more cooling, leading to accumulation of more ice, and so on. By the Pliocene (~5 Ma) ice sheets had started to grow in North America and northern Europe. The most intense part of the current glaciation — and the coldest climate conditions of the current glaciation — has been during the past million years (the last third of the Pleistocene).</p> <p>The Pleistocene Epoch of the Cenezoic Era (2.58 Ma to 0.126 Ma), is also known as the Ice Age, Pleistocene Glaciation, or Quaternary Glaciation. The Pleistocene has been characterized by temperature fluctuations over a range of almost 10°C on time scales of 40,000 to 100,000 years. These temperature variations have corresponding with expansion and contraction of ice sheets. The temperature variations are attributed to subtle changes in Earth’s orbit, tilt, and wobble. These cyclical changes are called <strong>Milankovitch cycles</strong>. Over the past million years, the glaciation cycles have cycled over every 100,000 years, approximately (Figure 17.37).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_565" style="width: 732px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record.png"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record.png" alt="" class="wp-image-565" width="732" height="339" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record.png 919w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record-300x139.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record-768x356.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record-65x30.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record-225x104.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record-350x162.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.37</strong> Foram oxygen isotope record for the past 5 million years based on O isotope data from sea-floor sediments <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a>.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-17-summary-2" title="Chapter 17 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">119</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 17 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>17.1 Types of Glaciers</h3> <p>The two main types of glaciers are continental glaciers, which are very large and cover large parts of continents (e.g. the Antarctic Ice Sheet), and alpine glaciers, which occupy mountainous regions. Ice accumulates at higher elevations — above the equilibrium line — where the snow that falls in winter does not all melt in summer. In continental glaciers, ice flows outward from where it is thickest. In alpine glaciers, ice also flows from thicker to thinner regions in the glacier, obeying the law of gravity. At depth in glacier ice, flow occurs through internal deformation, but glaciers that have liquid water at their base can also flow by basal sliding. Crevasses form in the rigid surface ice in places where the lower plastic ice is changing flow rate or shape as it moves over the underlying topography.</p> <h3>17.2 Glacial Erosion</h3> <p>Glaciers are important agents of erosion. Continental glaciers tend to erode land surface into flat plains, while alpine glaciers create a wide variety of different erosional features. The key feature of alpine glacial erosion is the U-shaped valley. Arêtes are sharp ridges that form between two valleys, and horns form where a mountain is glacially eroded on at least three sides. Since tributary glaciers do not erode as deeply as main-valley glaciers, hanging valleys exist where the two meet. On a smaller scale, both types of glaciers form roche moutonnées, d glacial grooves, and striae.</p> <h3>17.3 Glacial Deposits</h3> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">Glacial deposits form as materials are transported and deposited in a variety of different ways in a glacial environment. Sediments that are moved and deposited directly by ice are known as till. Till deposits left at the edges of the glacier as it recedes are known as moraines. Till can also form features such as drumlins (oval-shaped elongated hills) and kettle lakes. Glaciofluvial sediments are deposited by glacial streams, either forming eskers or large proglacial plains known as sandurs. Glaciolacustrine and glaciomarine sediments originate within glaciers and are deposited in lakes and oceans, respectively.</span></p> <h3>17.4 Glaciations over Earth&#8217;s History</h3> <p class="NormalOT"><span xml:lang="EN-US">There have been many glaciations in Earth’s past, the oldest known starting about 2.4 Ga. The late Proterozoic “Snowball Earth” glaciations were thought to be sufficiently intense to affect the entire planet. The Pleistocene Glaciation was a series of glacial events over the past 2.85 Ma. The periodicity of glaciations in the Pleistocene is related to subtle changes in Earth’s orbital characteristics (Milankovitch cycles), which are exaggerated by positive climate feedback processes. North America was most recently glaciated during the Wisconsinan Glaciation, from 150-50 ka. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <p>1. What feature of a continental glacier causes it to flow?</p> <p>2. Explain how alpine glacier ice flows.</p> <p>3. What does the equilibrium line represent in a glacier?</p> <p>4. Which of the following is more important to the growth of a glacier: very cold winters or relatively cool summers? Why?</p> <p>5. Describe the relative rates of ice flow, and why the rate distributions are the way they are, within the following parts of a glacier: (a) the bottom versus the top and (b) the edges versus the middle.</p> <p>6. Figure 17.40 shows thrust faults in the leading edge of the Athabasca glacier in Alberta. Find the thrust faults in the glacier. Note: they are harder to distinguish in this image than in Figure 17.12 because they don’t have sediments along the faults.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_578" style="width: 624px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Athabasca-Glacier.jpg"><img src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Athabasca-Glacier.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-578 size-full" width="624" height="289" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Athabasca-Glacier.jpg 624w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Athabasca-Glacier-300x139.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Athabasca-Glacier-65x30.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Athabasca-Glacier-225x104.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Athabasca-Glacier-350x162.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 17.40</strong> Edge of the Athabasca glacier in Alberta. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/thrusting-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>7.

Continental glaciers flow from the areas where the ice is thickest (and therefore at the highest elevation) toward areas (at the margins) where the ice is thinnest. Ice thickness tends to be related to the rate of ice accumulation.</p> <p>2.</p> <p>3. The equilibrium line represents the boundary between the area where ice is accumulating (typically at high elevations), and where it is being depleted (mostly by melting). Above the equilibrium line more snow accumulates in winter than can melt in summer so the glacier is always covered in snow. Below the equilibrium line the snow cover is lost by the end of summer.</p> <p>4. Relatively cool summers are more important because that controls how much snow will melt in the summer. In many situations very cold winters are associated with less snow accumulation than just cold winters.</p> <p>5. (a) The ice at the bottom of a glacier flows more slowly than that at the top. In fact if the glacier is frozen to its base the lowermost ice might not be moving at all. (b) The edges also flow more slowly than the middle because there is more friction there between the ice and the valley walls.</p> <p>6.</p> <p>7. Basal sliding will take place when the bed of the glacier is warm enough for water to be liquid. The water will act as a lubricant to allow the ice to flow.</p> <p>8.</p> <p>9. Glaciers carve U-shaped valleys because they are relatively wide (compared with rivers) and most of the erosion takes place at the base rather than the sides. A hanging valley forms where a tributary glacier joins a larger glacier and where the larger glacier has eroded a deeper valley.</p> <p>10. There must be at least three cirques to form a horn. In most cases there wouldn’t be room for more than four.</p> <p>11. A drumlin is relatively steep at the up-ice end and streamlined at the down-ice end. A roche moutonée is streamlined at the up-ice end and jagged at the down-ice end where plucking has taken place.</p> <p>12. Drop stones are large clasts that are present with lacustrine or marine glacial sediments. They form when coarse material drops from melting icebergs.</p> <p>13. Glaciofluvial sediments (sand or sand and gravel) are likely to be sufficiently permeable to make good aquifers.</p> <p>14. The Cryogenian glaciations are called Snowball Earth because it is thought that freezing conditions affected the entire planet and that the oceans were frozen over, even at the equator.</p> <p>15. The cooling from the end of the Paleocene until the Holocene was related to the formation of mountains including the Himalayas, the Rockies, and the Andes; the opening of the Drake Passage; the development of Antarctic Circumpolar Current; and the closing of the Isthmus of Panama.</p> <p>16. The first glaciation of the Cenozoic took place in Antarctica during the Oligocene (around 30 Ma).</p> <p>17. At the height of the last glaciation, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered almost all of Canada and extended south into the United States as far as Wisconsin.</p> <p>18. From left to right, the sediments are:</p> <p>Lodgement till: Poorly sorted, clay to boulders, no layering, large clasts not well rounded, no structures.</p> <p>Glaciofluvial sand and gravel: Bedded, some fine beds of sand, and some much coarser beds. Clasts are relatively well rounded.</p> <p>Ablation till: Poorly sorted, pebbles to boulders, no layering, large angular clasts, no apparent structures.</p> <p>Glaciofluvial sand: Sand- and silt-sized, well-sorted, bedded and cross-bedded.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div></div>

This includes water, of course, our most important resource, but it also includes all the other materials that we need to construct things like roads, dams, and bridges, or manufacture things like plates, toasters, and telephones. Even most of our energy resources come from Earth, including uranium and fossil fuels, and much of the infrastructure of this electrical age depends on copper (Figure 18.1).</div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1192" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Highland-Valley-Copper-Mine-at-Logan-Lake.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1192" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Highland-Valley-Copper-Mine-at-Logan-Lake-1024x572.jpg" alt="Figure 20.1 The open pit (background) and waste-rock piles (middle) of the Highland Valley Copper Mine at Logan Lake, British Columbia [Photo by Russell Hartlaub, used with permission]" width="400" height="223" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.1 The open pit (background) and waste-rock piles (middle) of the Highland Valley Copper Mine at Logan Lake, British Columbia [Photo by Russell Hartlaub, used with permission]</div></div> <p>Virtually everything we use every day is made from resources from Earth. For example, let’s look at a tablet computer (Figure 18.2). Most of the case is made of a plastic known as ABS, which is made from either gas or petroleum. Some tablets have a case made from aluminum. The glass of a touch screen is made mostly from quartz combined with smaller amounts of sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>O), sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), and calcium oxide (CaO). To make it work as a touch screen, the upper surface is coated with indium tin oxide. When you touch the screen you’re actually pushing a thin layer of polycarbonate plastic (made from petroleum) against the coated glass — completing an electrical circuit. The computer is then able to figure out exactly where you touched the screen. Computer processors are made from silica wafers (more quartz) and also include a significant amount of copper and gold. Gold is used because it is a better conductor than copper and doesn’t tarnish the way silver or copper does. Most computers have nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries, which contain nickel, of course, along with cadmium, cobalt, manganese, aluminum, and the rare-earth elements lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, and praseodymium. The processor and other electronic components are secured to a circuit board, which is a thin layer of fibreglass sandwiched between copper sheets coated with small amounts of tin and lead. Various parts are put together with steel screws that are made of iron and molybdenum.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1193" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/main-components-of-a-tablet-computer.png"><img class="wp-image-1193" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/main-components-of-a-tablet-computer.png" alt="Figure 20.2 The main components of a tablet computer [SE, base photograph from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/IPad_Air.png]" width="400" height="265" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.2 The main components of a tablet computer [SE, base photograph from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/IPad_Air.png]</div></div> <p>That’s not everything that goes into a tablet computer, but to make just those components we need a pure-silica sand deposit, a salt mine for sodium, a rock quarry for calcium, an oil well, a gas well, an aluminum mine, an iron mine, a manganese mine, a copper-molybdenum-gold mine, a cobalt-nickel mine, a rare-earth element and indium mine, and a source of energy to transport all of the materials, process them, put them together, and finally transport the computer to your house or the store where you bought it.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercise 18.1 Where Does It Come From?</h3> <p>Look around you and find at least five objects (other than a computer or a phone) that have been made from materials that had to be mined, quarried, or extracted from an oil or gas well.

Canada has some of the largest mining districts and deposits in the world, and for the past 150 years, we have been one of the most important suppliers of metals. Extraction of Earth’s resources goes back a long way in Canada. For example, the First Nations of British Columbia extracted obsidian from volcanic regions for tools and traded it up and down the coast. In the 1850s, gold was discovered in central British Columbia, and in the 1890s, even more gold was discovered in the Klondike area of Yukon. These two events were critical to the early development of British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska.</p> <p>Canada’s mining sector had revenues in the order of $37 billion in 2013. The majority of that was split roughly equally among gold, iron, copper, and potash, with important but lesser amounts from nickel and diamonds (Figure 18.3). Revenues from the petroleum sector are significantly higher, at over $100 billion per year.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1195" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/value-of-various-Canadian-mining-sectors-in-2013.png"><img class="wp-image-1195" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/value-of-various-Canadian-mining-sectors-in-2013.png" alt="Figure 20.3 The value of various Canadian mining sectors in 2013 [SE from data at http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mining-materials/publications/8772]" width="400" height="242" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.3 The value of various Canadian mining sectors in 2013 [SE from data at http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mining-materials/publications/8772]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A metal deposit is a body of rock in which one or more metals have been concentrated to the point of being economically viable for recovery. Some <strong>background</strong> levels of important metals in average rocks are shown on Table 18.1, along with the typical grades necessary to make a viable deposit, and the corresponding concentration factors. Looking at copper, for example, we can see that while average rock has around 40 ppm (parts per million) of copper, a grade of around 10,000 ppm or 1% is necessary to make a viable copper deposit. In other words, copper ore has about 250 times as much copper as typical rock. For the other elements in the list, the concentration factors are much higher. For gold, it’s 2,000 times and for silver it’s around 10,000 times.</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Metal</strong></td> <td><strong>Typical Background Level</strong></td> <td><strong>Typical Economic Grade*</strong></td> <td><strong>Concentration Factor</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>Copper</td> <td>40 ppm</td> <td>10,000 ppm (1%)</td> <td>250 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Gold</td> <td>0.003 ppm</td> <td>6 ppm (0.006%)</td> <td>2,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Lead</td> <td>10 ppm</td> <td>50,000 ppm (5%</td> <td>5,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Molybdenum</td> <td>1 ppm</td> <td>1,000 ppm (0.1%)</td> <td>1,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Nickel</td> <td>25 ppm</td> <td>20,000 ppm (2%)</td> <td>800 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Silver</td> <td>0.1 ppm</td> <td>1,000 ppm (0.1%)</td> <td>10,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Uranium</td> <td>2 ppm</td> <td>10,000 ppm (1%)</td> <td>5,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Zinc</td> <td>50 ppm</td> <td>50,000 ppm (5%)</td> <td>1,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="4"></td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="4">*It’s important to note that the economic viability of any deposit depends on a wide range of factors including its grade, size, shape, depth below the surface, and proximity to infrastructure, the current price of the metal, the labour and environmental regulations in the area, and many other factors.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Table 18.1 Typical background and ore levels of some important metals [SE]</p> <p>It is clear that some very significant concentration must take place to form a mineable deposit. This concentration may occur during the formation of the host rock, or after the rock forms, through a number of different types of processes. There is a very wide variety of ore-forming processes, and there are hundreds of types of mineral deposits. The origins of a few of them are described below.</p> <h1>Types of Metal Deposits</h1> <h2>Magmatic Nickel Deposits</h2> <p>A magmatic deposit is one in which the metal concentration takes place primarily at the same time as the formation and emplacement of the magma. Most of the nickel mined in Canada comes from magmatic deposits such as those in Sudbury (Ontario), Thompson (Manitoba) (Figure 18.4), and Voisey’s Bay (Labrador). The magmas from which these deposits form are of mafic or ultramafic composition (derived from the mantle), and therefore they have relatively high nickel and copper contents to begin with (as much as 100 times more than normal rocks in the case of nickel). These elements may be further concentrated within the magma as a result of the addition of sulphur from partial melting of the surrounding rocks. The heavy nickel and copper sulphide minerals are then concentrated further still by gravity segregation (i.e., crystals settling toward the bottom of the magma chamber). In some cases, there are significant concentrations of platinum-bearing minerals.</p> <p>Most of these types of deposits around the world are Precambrian in age — probably because the mantle was significantly hotter at that time, and the necessary mafic and ultramafic magmas were more likely to be emplaced in the continental crust.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1196" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/nickel-smelter-at-Thompson.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1196" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/nickel-smelter-at-Thompson-1024x547.jpg" alt="Figure 20.4 The nickel smelter at Thompson, Manitoba [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson,_Manitoba#/media/File:Vale_Nickel_Mine.JPG]" width="400" height="214" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.4 The nickel smelter at Thompson, Manitoba [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson,_Manitoba#/media/File:Vale_Nickel_Mine.JPG]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposits</h2> <p>Much of the copper, zinc, lead, silver, and gold mined in Canada is mined from <strong>volcanic</strong>–<strong>hosted</strong> <strong>massive sulphide (VHMS)</strong> deposits associated with submarine volcanism (VMS deposits). Examples are the deposits at Kidd Creek, Ontario, Flin Flon on the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border, Britannia on Howe Sound, and Myra Falls (within Strathcona Park) on Vancouver Island.</p> <p>VMS deposits are formed from the water discharged at high temperature (250° to 300°C) at ocean-floor hydrothermal vents, primarily in areas of subduction-zone volcanism. The environment is comparable to that of modern-day black smokers (Figure 18.5), which form where hot metal- and sulphide-rich water issues from the sea floor. They are called massive sulphide deposits because the sulphide minerals (including pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) , sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), and galena (PbS)) are generally present in very high concentrations (making up the majority of the rock in some cases). The metals and the sulphur are leached out of the sea-floor rocks by convecting groundwater driven by the volcanic heat, and then quickly precipitated where that hot water enters the cold seawater, causing it to cool suddenly and change chemically. The volcanic rock that hosts the deposits is formed in the same area and at the same general time as the accumulation of the ore minerals.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/black-smoker-on-the-Juan-de-Fuca-Ridge.png"><img class="wp-image-1197" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/black-smoker-on-the-Juan-de-Fuca-Ridge-1024x595.png" alt="Figure 20.5 Left: A black smoker on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

Most porphyry deposits also host some gold, which may be, in rare cases, the primary commodity. B.C. examples include several large deposits within the Highland Valley mine (Figure 18.1) and numerous other deposits scattered around the central part of the province.</p> <p>A porphyry deposit forms around a cooling felsicstock in the upper part of the crust. They are called “porphyry” because upper crustal stocks are typically porphyritic in texture, the result of a two-stage cooling process. Metal enrichment results in part from convection of groundwater related to the heat of the stock, and also from metal-rich hot water expelled by the cooling magma (Figure 18.6). The host rocks, which commonly include the stock itself and the surrounding country rocks, are normally highly fractured and brecciated. During the ore-forming process, some of the original minerals in these rocks are altered to potassium feldspar, biotite, epidote, and various clay minerals. The important ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), bornite (Cu<sub>5</sub>FeS<sub>4</sub>), and pyrite in copper porphyry deposits, or molybdenite (MoS<sub>2</sub>) and pyrite in molybdenum porphyry deposits. Gold is present as minute flakes of native gold.</p> <p>This type of environment (i.e., around and above an intrusive body) is also favourable for the formation of other types of deposits — particularly vein-type gold deposits (a.k.a. <strong>epithermal deposits</strong>). Some of the gold deposits of British Columbia (such as in the Eskay Creek area adjacent to the Alaska panhandle), and many of the other gold deposits situated along the western edge of both South and North America are of the vein type shown in Figure 18.6, and are related to nearby magma bodies.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1198" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/the-formation-of-a-porphyry-deposit.png"><img class="wp-image-1198" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/the-formation-of-a-porphyry-deposit.png" alt="Figure 20.6 A model for the formation of a porphyry deposit around an upper-crustal porphyritic stock and associated vein deposits.

At that time, iron that was present in dissolved form in the ocean (as Fe<sup>2+</sup>) became oxidized to its insoluble form (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) and accumulated on the sea floor, mostly as hematite interbedded with chert (Figure 18.7). Unlike many other metals, which are economically viable at grades of around 1% or even much less, iron deposits are only viable if the grades are in the order of 50% iron and if they are very large.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_3370" style="width: 2692px"><a href="#chapter-18-2-metal-deposits" rel="attachment wp-att-3370"><img class="wp-image-3370 size-full" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka.jpg" alt="" width="2692" height="1936" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka.jpg 2692w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka-300x216.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka-768x552.jpg 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka-1024x736.jpg 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka-65x47.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka-225x162.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/02/Black-band_ironstone_aka-350x252.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.7 Banded iron formation from an unknown location in North America on display at a museum in Germany.

These are called <strong>unconformity-type</strong> <strong>uranium deposits</strong> because they are all situated very close to the unconformity between the Proterozoic Athabasca Group sandstone and the much older Archean sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive igneous rock (Figure 18.8). The origin of unconformity-type U deposits is not perfectly understood, but it is thought that two particular features are important: (1) the relative permeability of the Athabasca Group sandstone, and (2) the presence of graphitic schist within the underlying Archean rocks. The permeability of the sandstone allowed groundwater to flow through it and leach out small amounts of U, which stayed in solution in the oxidized form U<sup>6+</sup>. The graphite (C) created a reducing environment (non-oxidizing) that converted the U from U<sup>6+</sup> to insoluble U<sup>4+</sup>, at which point it was precipitated as the mineral uraninite (UO<sub>2</sub>).</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercise 18.2 The Importance of Heat and Heat Engines</h3> <p>For a variety of reasons, thermal energy (heat) from within Earth is critical in the formation of many types of ore deposits.

Relatively large deposits that are quite close to the surface and somewhat regular in shape are mined using <strong>open-pit mine</strong> methods (Figure 18.1). Creating a giant hole in the ground is generally cheaper than making an underground mine, but it is also less precise, so it is necessary to mine a lot of waste rock along with the ore. Relatively deep deposits or those with elongated or irregular shapes are typically mined from underground with deep vertical <strong>shafts</strong>, <strong>declines</strong> (sloped tunnels), and <strong>levels</strong> (horizontal tunnels) (Figures 18.9 and 18.10). In this way, it is possible to focus the mining on the ore body itself.

[SE]</div></div> <p>A typical metal deposit might contain a few percent of ore minerals (e.g., chalcopyrite or sphalerite), mixed with the minerals of the original rock (e.g., quartz or feldspar). Other sulphide minerals are commonly present within the ore, especially pyrite.</p> <p>When ore is processed (typically very close to the mine), it is ground to a fine powder and the ore minerals are physically separated from the rest of the rock to make a <strong>concentrate</strong>. At a molybdenum mine, for example, this concentrate may be almost pure molybdenite (MoS<sub>2</sub>). The rest of the rock is known as <strong>tailings</strong>. It comes out of the concentrator as a wet slurry and must be stored near the mine, in most cases, in a tailings pond.</p> <p>The tailings pond at the Myra Falls Mine on Vancouver Island is shown in Figure 18.12, and the settling ponds for waste water from the concentrator are shown in Figure 18.13. The tailings are contained by an embankment. Also visible in the foreground of Figure 18.12 is a pile of waste rock, which is non-ore rock that was mined in order to access the ore. Although this waste rock contains little or no ore minerals, at many mines it contains up to a few percent pyrite. The tailings and the waste rock at most mines are an environmental liability because they contain pyrite plus small amounts of ore minerals. When pyrite is exposed to oxygen and water, it generates sulphuric acid — also known as <strong>acid rock drainage</strong> (ARD). Acidity itself is a problem to the environment, but because the ore elements, such as copper or lead, are more soluble in acidic water than neutral water, ARD is also typically quite rich in metals, many of which are toxic.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1204" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/tailings-pond-at-the-Myra-Falls-Mine.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1204" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tailings-pond-at-the-Myra-Falls-Mine.jpg" alt="Figure 20.12 The tailings pond at the Myra Falls Mine on Vancouver Island.

But separation of ore minerals is only the preliminary stage of metal refinement, for most metals the second stage involves separating the actual elements within the ore minerals. For example, the most common ore of copper is chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>). The copper needs to be separated from the iron and sulphur to make copper metal and that involves complicated and very energy-intensive processes that are done at <strong>smelters</strong> or other types of refineries. Because of their cost and the economies of scale, there are far fewer refineries than there are mines.</p> <p>There are several metal refineries (including smelters) in Canada; some examples are the aluminum refinery in Kitimat, B.C. (which uses ore from overseas); the lead-zinc smelter in Trail, B.C.; the nickel smelter at Thompson, Manitoba; numerous steel smelters in Ontario, along with several other refining operations for nickel, copper, zinc, and uranium; aluminum refineries in Quebec; and a lead smelter in New Brunswick.</p> </div></div>

For everything made out of concrete or asphalt, we need sand and gravel. To make the cement that holds concrete together, we also need limestone. For the glass in our computer screens and for glass-sided buildings, we need silica sand plus sodium oxide (Na<sub>2</sub>O), sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), and calcium oxide (CaO). Potassium is an essential nutrient for farming in many areas, and for a wide range of applications (e.g., ceramics and many industrial processes), we also need various types of clay.</p> <p>The best types of <strong>aggregate</strong> (sand and gravel) resources are those that have been sorted by streams, and in Canada the most abundant and accessible fluvial deposits are associated with glaciation. That doesn’t include till of course, because it has too much silt and clay, but it does include glaciofluvial outwash, which is present in thick deposits in many parts of the country, similar to the one shown in Figure 18.15. In a typical gravel pit, these materials are graded on-site according to size and then used in a wide range of applications from constructing huge concrete dams to filling children’s sandboxes. Sand is also used to make glass, but for most types of glass, it has to be at least 95% quartz (which the sandy layers shown in Figure 18.15 are definitely not), and for high-purity glass and the silicon wafers used for electronics, the source sand has to be over 98% quartz.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1208" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Sand-and-gravel-in-an-aggregate-pit.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1208" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Sand-and-gravel-in-an-aggregate-pit-1024x529.jpg" alt="Figure 20.15 Sand and gravel in an aggregate pit near Nanaimo, BC.

The cement used for concrete is made from approximately 80% calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) and 20% clay. This mixture is heated to 1450°C to produce the required calcium silicate compounds (e.g., Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>). The calcite typically comes from limestone quarries like the one on Texada Island, B.C. (Figure 18.16). Limestone is also used as the source material for many other products that require calcium compounds, including steel and glass, pulp and paper, and plaster products for construction.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1209" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Triassic-Quatsino-Formation-limestone.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1209" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Triassic-Quatsino-Formation-limestone-1024x535.jpg" alt="Figure 20.16 Triassic Quatsino Formation limestone being quarried on Texada Island, B.C.

The largest salt mine in the world is at Goderich, Ontario, where salt is recovered from the 100 m thick Silurian Salina Formation. The same formation is mined in the Windsor area. Rock salt is also used as a source of sodium and chlorine in the chemical industry to melt ice on roads, as part of the process of softening water, and as a seasoning. Under certain conditions, the mineral sylvite (KCl) accumulates in evaporite beds, and this rock is called potash. This happened across the Canadian prairies during the Devonian, creating the Prairie evaporite formation (Figure 6.16). Potassium is used as a crop fertilizer, and Canada is the world’s leading supplier, with most of that production coming from Saskatchewan.</p> <p>Another evaporite mineral, gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>0), is the main component of plasterboard (drywall) that is widely used in the construction industry. One of the main mining areas for gypsum in Canada is in the Milford Station area of Nova Scotia, site of the world’s largest gypsum mine.</p> <p>Rocks are quarried or mined for many different uses, such as building facades (Figure 18.17), countertops, stone floors, and headstones. In most of these cases, the favoured rock types are granitic rocks, slate, and marble.

Fossil fuels are rich in carbon and almost all of that carbon ultimately originates from CO<sub>2</sub> taken out of the atmosphere during photosynthesis. That process, driven by solar energy, involves reduction (the opposite of oxidation) of the carbon, resulting in it being combined with hydrogen instead of oxygen. The resulting organic matter is made up of complex and varied carbohydrate molecules.</p> <p>Most organic matter is oxidized back to CO<sub>2</sub> relatively quickly (within weeks or years in most cases), but any of it that gets isolated from the oxygen of the atmosphere (for example, deep in the ocean or in a stagnant bog) may last long enough to be buried by sediments and, if so, may be preserved for tens to hundreds of millions of years. Under natural conditions, that means it will be stored until those rocks are eventually exposed at the surface and weathered.</p> <p>In this section, we’ll discuss the origins and extraction of the important fossils fuels, including coal, oil, and gas.</p> <h1>Coal</h1> <p>Coal was the first fossil fuel to be widely used. As we learned in section 9.4, coal forms where vigorous growth of vegetation in swampy areas leads to an abundance of organic matter that accumulates within stagnant water. The chemical nature of the water- it being acidic and having little to no oxygen- means the organic matter decays very little. If a thick layer of organic matter is accumulated and then buried, the organic matter begins to change as it is compressed and heated. This situation, where the dead organic matter is submerged in oxygen-poor water, must be maintained for centuries to millennia in order for enough material to accumulate to form a thick layer. Over time, as the organic matter is heated and compressed more and more, the carbon within it becomes concentrated, and it can provide more energy when it is burned. Figure 18.18 shows the classification system for different grades of coal. Increasing pressure and temperature means proceeding clockwise through the diagram, starting with <strong>lignite</strong> (the lowest grade), then <strong>bituminous coal</strong>, and finally <strong>anthracite</strong>, the highest grade.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 423px"><a href="https://physicalgeology.pressbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44994/2016/01/Coal_Rank_USGS.png"><img class="wp-image-1800" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Coal_Rank_USGS-240x300.png" alt="Coal ranking system used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

In Alberta and Saskatchewan, much of the coal is used for electricity generation. Coal from the Highvale Mine (Figure 18.19), Canada’s largest, is used to feed the Sundance and Keephills power stations west of Edmonton. Almost all of the coal mined in British Columbia is exported for use in manufacturing steel.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Highvale-Mine-and-the-Sundance.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1212" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Highvale-Mine-and-the-Sundance.jpg" alt="Figure 20.19 The Highvale Mine (background) and the Sundance (right) and Keephills (left) generating stations on the southern shore of Wabamun Lake, Alberta [SE]" width="400" height="188" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.19 The Highvale Mine (background) and the Sundance (right) and Keephills (left) generating stations on the southern shore of Wabamun Lake, Alberta [SE]</div></div> <h1>Oil and Gas</h1> <p>While almost all coal forms on land from terrestrial vegetation, most oil and gas is derived primarily from marine micro-organisms that accumulate within sea-floor sediments. In areas where marine productivity is high, dead organic matter is delivered to the sea floor fast enough that some of it escapes oxidation. This material accumulates in the muddy sediments, which become buried to significant depth beneath other sediments.</p> <p>As the depth of burial increases, so does the temperature — due to the geothermal gradient — and gradually the organic matter within the sediments is converted to hydrocarbons (Figure 18.20). The first stage is the biological production (involving anaerobic bacteria) of methane. Most of this escapes back to the surface, but some is trapped in methane hydrates near the sea floor. At depths beyond about 2 km, and at temperatures ranging from 60° to 120°C, the organic matter is converted by chemical processes to oil. This depth and temperature range is known as the <strong>oil window</strong>. Beyond 120°C most of the organic matter is chemically converted to methane.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1213" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/depth-and-temperature-limits-for-biogenic-gas.png"><img class="wp-image-1213" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/depth-and-temperature-limits-for-biogenic-gas.png" alt="Figure 20.20 The depth and temperature limits for biogenic gas, oil, and thermogenic gas [SE]" width="400" height="301" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.20 The depth and temperature limits for biogenic gas, oil, and thermogenic gas [SE]</div></div> <p>The organic matter-bearing rock within which the formation of gas and oil takes place is known to petroleum geologists as the <strong>source rock</strong>. Both liquid oil and gaseous methane are lighter than water, so as liquids and gases form, they tend to move slowly toward the surface, out of the source rock and into <strong>reservoir rocks</strong>. Reservoir rocks are typically relatively permeable because that allows migration of the fluids from the source rocks, and also facilitates recovery of the oil or gas. In some cases, the liquids and gases make it all the way to the surface, where they are oxidized, and the carbon is returned to the atmosphere. But in other cases, they are contained by overlying impermeable rocks (e.g., mudrock) in situations where anticlines, faults, stratigraphy changes, and reefs or salt domes create traps (Figure 18.21).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1214" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Migration-of-oil-and-gas.png"><img class="wp-image-1214" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Migration-of-oil-and-gas.png" alt="Figure 20.21 Migration of oil and gas from source rocks into traps in reservoir rocks [SE]" width="400" height="213" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.21 Migration of oil and gas from source rocks into traps in reservoir rocks [SE]</div></div> <p>The liquids and gases that are trapped within reservoirs become separated into layers based on their density, with gas rising to the top, oil below it, and water underneath the oil. The proportions of oil and gas depend primarily on the temperature in the source rocks. Some petroleum fields, such as many of those in Alberta, are dominated by oil, while others, notably those in northeastern B.C., are dominated by gas.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1215" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Seismic-section-through-the-East-Breaks-Field.png"><img class="wp-image-1215" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Seismic-section-through-the-East-Breaks-Field.png" alt="Figure 20.22 Seismic section through the East Breaks Field in the Gulf of Mexico.

Seismic surveys are the most commonly used tool for early-stage petroleum exploration, as they can reveal important information about the stratigraphy and structural geology of subsurface sedimentary rocks. An example from the Gulf of Mexico south of Texas is shown in Figure 18.22. In this area, a thick evaporite deposit (“salt”) has formed domes because salt is lighter than other sediments and tends to rise slowly toward the surface; this has created traps. The sequence of deformed rocks is capped with a layer of undeformed rock.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercise 18.4 Interpreting a Seismic Profile</h3> <p>The cross-section shown here is from a ship-borne seismic survey in the Bering Sea off the west coast of Alaska.

Some unconventional types of oil and gas include oil sands, shale gas, and coal-bed methane.</p> <h3>Oil Sands</h3> <p>Oil sands are important because the reserves in Alberta are so large (the largest single reserve of oil in the world), but they are very controversial from an environmental and social perspective. They are “unconventional” because the oil is exposed near the surface and is highly viscous because of microbial changes that have taken place at the surface. The hydrocarbons that form this reserve originated in deeply buried Paleozoic rocks adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and migrated up and toward the east (Figure 18.23).</p> <p>The oil sands are controversial primarily because of the environmental cost of their extraction. Since the oil is so viscous, it requires heat to make it sufficiently liquid to process. This energy comes from gas; approximately 25 m<sup>3</sup> of gas is used to produce 0.16 m<sup>3</sup> (one barrel) of oil. (That’s not quite as bad as it sounds, as the energy equivalent of the required gas is about 20% of the energy embodied in the produced oil.) The other environmental cost of oil sands production is the devastation of vast areas of land where strip-mining is taking place and tailings ponds are constructed, and the unavoidable release of contaminants into the groundwater and rivers of the region.</p> <p>At present, most oil recovery from oil sands is achieved by mining the sand and processing it on site. Exploitation of oil sand that is not exposed at the surface depends on in situ processes, an example being the injection of steam into the oil-sand layer to reduce the viscosity of the oil so that it can be pumped to the surface.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1217" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Schematic-cross-section-of-northern-Alberta.png"><img class="wp-image-1217" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Schematic-cross-section-of-northern-Alberta-1024x470.png" alt="Figure 20.23 Schematic cross-section of northern Alberta showing the source rocks and location of the Athabasca Oil Sands [SE]" width="400" height="184" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 18.23 Schematic cross-section of northern Alberta showing the source rocks and location of the Athabasca Oil Sands [SE]</div></div> <h3>Shale Gas</h3> <p>Shale gas is gas that is trapped within rock that is too impermeable for the gas to escape under normal conditions, and it can only be extracted by fracturing the reservoir rock using water and chemicals under extremely high pressure. This procedure is known as <strong>hydraulic fracturing</strong> or “<strong>fracking.</strong>” Fracking is controversial because of the volume of water used, and because, in some jurisdictions, the fracking companies are not required to disclose the nature of the chemicals used. Although fracking is typically done at significant depths, there is always the risk that overlying water-supply aquifers could be contaminated (Figure 18.24). Fracking also induces low-level seismicity (earthquakes).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1218" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Depiction-of-the-process-of-directional-drilling-and-fracking.png"><img class="wp-image-1218" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Depiction-of-the-process-of-directional-drilling-and-fracking-1024x434.png" alt="Figure 20.24 Depiction of the process of directional drilling and fracking to recover gas from impermeable rocks.

When coal is mined, methane is released into the mine where it can become a serious explosion hazard. Modern coal-mining machines have methane detectors on them and actually stop operating if the methane levels are dangerous. It is possible to extract the methane from coal beds without mining the coal; gas recovered this way is known as <strong>coal-bed methane</strong>.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-18-5-diamonds" title="18.5 Diamonds"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">125</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">18.5 Diamonds</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>Although Canada’s diamond mining industry didn’t get started until 1998, diamonds are currently the sixth most valuable product mined in the country (Figure 18.3), and Canada ranks sixth in the world in diamond production. Diamonds form deep in the mantle (approximately 200 km to 250 km depth) under very specific pressure and temperature conditions, from carbon that is naturally present in mantle rock (not from coal). The diamond-bearing rock is brought to the surface coincidentally via a type of volcanism that is extremely rare (the most recent kimberlite eruption is thought to have taken place 10,000 years ago and prior to that at around 30 Ma). There is more on the volcanology of kimberlites in section 11.3. All of the world’s kimberlite diamond deposits are situated within ancient shield areas (<strong>cratons</strong>) in Africa, Australia, Russia, South America, and North America.</p> <p>It has long been known that diamonds could exist within the Canadian Shield, but up until 1991, exploration efforts had been unsuccessful. In 1980 two geologists, Chuck Fipke and Stu Blusson, started searching in the Northwest Territories by sampling glacial sediments looking for some of the minerals that are normally quite abundant within <strong>kimberlites</strong>: chromium-bearing garnet, chromium-bearing pyroxene, chromite (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>). These distinctive minerals are used for this type of exploration because they are many times more abundant in kimberlite than diamond is. After more than a decade of exploration, Fipke and Blusson finally focused their search on an area 250 km northeast of Yellowknife, and, in 1991, they announced the discovery of a diamond-bearing kimberlite body at Lac de Gras. That discovery is now the Diavik Mine, and there is another diamond mine — Ekati — 25 km to the northwest (Figure 18.25). There are two separate mines at Diavik accessing three different kimberlite bodies, and there are five at Ekati. See Figure 11.22 for a close-up view of the Ekati Mine. There are six operating diamond mines in Canada, four in the Northwest Territories (including Diavik and Ekati), and one each in Nunavut and Ontario.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1219" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Diamond-mines-in-the-Lac-de-Gras-region.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1219" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Diamond-mines-in-the-Lac-de-Gras-region-1024x509.jpg" alt="Figure 20.25 Diamond mines in the Lac de Gras region, Nunavut.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-18-summary" title="Chapter 18 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">126</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 18 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The main topics of this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <h3>18.1 If You Can&#8217;t Grow It, You Have To Mine It</h3> <p>Geological resources are critical to our way of life and important to the Canadian economy. Gold, iron, copper, nickel, and potash are Canada’s most valuable mined commodities.</p> <h3>18.2 Metal Deposits</h3> <p>The proportions of metals in mineral deposits are typically several thousand times higher than those in average rocks, and special processes are required to extract the valuable content. Some deposits form through processes within a magma chamber, others during volcanism or adjacent to a stock, and some are related to sedimentary processes. Mining involves both surface and underground methods, but in either case, rock is brought to surface that can react with water and oxygen to produce acid rock drainage and metal contamination.</p> <h3>18.3 Industrial Materials</h3> <p>Non-metallic materials are very important to infrastructure and agriculture. Some of the major industrial minerals include sand and gravel, limestone for cement and agriculture, salt for a range of applications, potash fertilizer, and decorative stone.</p> <h3>18.4 Fossil Fuels</h3> <p>The main fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas. Coal forms on land in wet environments where organic matter can remain submerged and isolated from oxygen for millennia before it is buried by more sediments. The depth of that burial influences the grade of coal produced. Oil and gas originate from organisms living in marine environments, and again, fairly rapid burial is required to preserve the organic matter on the sea floor. At moderate burial depth (2 km to 4 km), oil is produced, and at greater depth, gas is produced. Both oil and gas migrate toward the surface and can be trapped beneath impermeable rock layers in structural features, such as anticlines or faults. Some unconventional fossil fuel resources include oil sands, shale gas, and coal-bed methane.</p> <h3>18.5 Diamonds</h3> <p>Diamonds originate in the mantle and are only brought to the surface by the very rare eruption of kimberlitic volcanoes. The relatively recent discovery of diamonds in Canada was based on the exhaustive search for diamond indicator minerals in glacial sediments. There are now six diamond mines in Canada.</p> <h2>Questions for Review</h2> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><p>1.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-answers-to-chapter-18-review-questions" title="Answers to Chapter 18 Review Questions"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">127</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Answers to Chapter 18 Review Questions</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>1. Some of the components of a compact fluorescent lightbulb (and the resources used to make one) are as follows:</p> <ul><li>Steel (iron, carbon from coal plus some manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum)</li> <li>Plastic housing (petroleum)</li> <li>Glass coil (silica from sand, plus minor amounts of sodium, calcium, and magnesium)</li> <li>Copper conductors, lead solder, and basal contact</li> <li>Silica (sand), plastics (petroleum), ceramics (clay), aluminum, gold, copper, etc. in the electronics</li> <li>Mercury inside the tube (less than 5 mg)</li> </ul> <p>2. Nickel deposits form within mafic and ultramafic igneous bodies because the original magma have relatively high nickel levels to begin with, while intermediate or felsic magma have low levels.</p> <p>3. The “smoke” in a black smoker is composed of tiny crystals of sulphide minerals. If those include significant quantities of ore minerals like chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), sphalerite (ZnS), and galena (PbS), a VMS deposit could form during this process.</p> <p>4. A porphyry deposit is situated in the rock around an igneous pluton that has intruded to a relatively high level in the crust (and hence is porphyritic), and they form at least in part from fluids released by the magma. Epigenetic gold deposits may be formed from the same or similar fluids, but are situated at a greater distance from the pluton/</p> <p>5. Ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) is soluble in water with a low oxidation potential, and gets converted to insoluble ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) when the water becomes oxidized. The opposite situation happens with uranium. Uranyl uranium (U<sup>6+</sup>) is soluble under oxidizing conditions, but when the water in which it is dissolved encounters reducing conditions the uranium is converted to the insoluble uranous ion (U<sup>4+</sup>).</p> <p>6. It is common for the upper part of a kimberlite to be mined using an open pit (in this case around 500 m wide and up to 500 m deep), and for the lower part to be mined underground.</p> <p>7. Pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) is typically responsible for acid rock drainage around mine sites, and it is very common for pyrite to form within the rock at the same time that other metal sulphides (e.g., chalcopyrite) are forming.</p> <p>8. Glaciofluvial gravels are typically relatively well sorted, and may include clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Till, on the other hand, tends to be poorly sorted and may have clasts ranging from clay to boulders. More processing would be needed to separate the required size ranges, and because till tends to be relatively hard and strong, this would require a lot of effort.</p> <p>9. During the manufacture of CaO limestone is heated and CO<sub>2</sub> is released to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. The energy required for this process typically comes from fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas) and the combustion also releases CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>10. Some important evaporite minerals include halite (NaCl), sylvite (KCl), and gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O).</p> <p>11. The 15 m of organic matter required to make 1.5 m of coal, is equivalent to 15,000 mm, and if the organic matter accumulates at 1 mm/y that would require 15,000 years. That organic matter would have to remain submerged in oxygen-poor water for at least that length of time.</p> <p>12. Petroleum source rocks must have a significant component of organic matter, and then need to be buried to at least 2,500 m depth so that the organic matter can be converted to oil or gas. Reservoir rocks must be both porous and permeable, so that the petroleum liquids can be extracted, and should also take the form of a trap (e.g., an anticline) and capped with impermeable rock.</p> <p>13. The optimum depth for the generation of oil from buried organic matter is 2,500 to 3,500 m.</p> <p>14. Shale gas is an unconventional reserve because shale is not permeable enough to allow the gas to be extracted. The rock has to be fractured (fracked) to allow recovery. Fracking involves the use of vast amounts of water, and there is the potential that the fracking fluids can contaminate freshwater aquifers.</p> <p>15. Kimberlite indicator minerals are much more abundant than diamonds within kimberlites, and so they can typically be detected further away from the kimberlite source, and over a much wider area.</p> </div></div>

Geological time is vast, and Earth has changed tremendously during this time. Even though most geological processes are very, very slow, the vast amount of time that has passed has allowed for the formation of extraordinary geological features, as shown in Figure 19.1.</p> <p>We have numerous ways of measuring geological time. We can tell the relative ages of rocks (e.g., whether one rock is older than another) based on their spatial relationships, we can use fossils to date sedimentary rocks because we have a detailed record of the evolution of life on Earth, and we can use a range of isotopic techniques to determine the absolute ages (in millions of years) of igneous and metamorphic rocks.</p> <p>But just because we can measure geological time doesn’t mean that we understand it. One of the biggest hurdles faced by geology students—and geologists as well—in understanding geology is to really come to grips with the slow rates at which geological processes happen, and the vast amount of time involved.</p></div>

Hutton studied present-day processes and applied his observations to the rock record in order to understand what he saw there. Such a method is now encapsulated in the <strong>principle of uniformitarianism</strong>, which states that the present is the key to the past. Given that many geological processes that we can see happening around us occur at very slow rates, Hutton concluded that geological time must be very long indeed to account for the large changes apparent in the rock record. But this principle needs to be taken with a grain of salt: there are some processes that have occurred in the past that are no longer occurring (e.g., eruption of ultramafic lavas), as well as some processes that occur so irregularly that we have not yet witnessed such an event in historic time (e.g., impact of a large asteroid with Earth).</p> <p>William Smith worked as a surveyor in the coal-mining and canal-building industries in south-western England in the late 1700s and early 1800s. While doing his work, he had many opportunities to observe Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the region, and he did so in a way that few had done before. Smith noticed the textural similarities and differences between rocks in different locations. More importantly, he discovered that fossils could be used to correlate rocks of the same age. Smith is credited with formulating the <strong>principle of faunal succession</strong>, the concept that specific types of organisms lived during different time intervals. He used the principle of faunal succession to great effect in his monumental project to create a geological map of England and Wales, published in 1815.</p> <p>Inset into Smith’s great geological map is a small diagram showing a schematic geological cross-section extending from the Thames estuary of eastern England to the west coast of Wales. Smith showed the sequence of rocks, from the Paleozoic rocks of Wales and western England, through the Mesozoic rocks of central England, to the Cenozoic rocks of the area around London (Figure 19.2).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_645" style="width: 650px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales-e1439316487427.png"><img class="wp-image-645" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales-e1439316487427.png" alt="" width="650" height="238" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales-e1439316487427.png 500w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales-e1439316487427-300x110.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales-e1439316487427-65x24.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales-e1439316487427-225x82.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales-e1439316487427-350x128.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.2</strong> William Smith’s “Sketch of the succession of strata and their relative altitudes,” an inset on his geological map of England and Wales (with era names added). <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 view source, modified after William Smith (1815) Public Domain <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Geological_map_Britain_William_Smith_1815.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view map</a>.</em></div></div> <p>Smith did not put any dates on these rocks, because he didn’t know them. But he was aware of the <strong>principle of superposition</strong>, the idea developed much earlier by the Danish theologian and scientist Nicholas Steno, that young sedimentary rocks form on top of older ones. Therefore, Smith knew that this diagram represented a stratigraphic column. And since almost every period of the Phanerozoic is represented along this section through Wales and England, it is also a primitive geological time scale.</p> <p>Smith’s work set the stage for the naming and ordering of the geological time periods, which was initiated around 1820, first by British geologists, and later by other European geologists. Many of the periods are named for places where rocks of that age are found in Europe, such as Cambrian for Cambria in Wales, Devonian for Devon in England, Jurassic for the Jura Mountains in France and Switzerland, and Permian for the Perm region of Russia. Some are named for the type of rock that is common during that age, such as Carboniferous for the coal-bearing rocks of England, and Cretaceous for the chalks of England and France.</p> <p>The early time scales were only relative because 19th century geologists did not know the absolute ages of rocks. This information was not available until the development of isotopic dating techniques early in the 20th century.</p> <p>The geological timescale is currently maintained by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), which is part of the International Union of Geological Sciences. The time scale is continuously being updated as we learn more about the timing and nature of past geological events. <a href="http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View the ICS timescale.</a></p> <p>Geological time has been divided into four eons: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic (Figure 19.3). The first three of these eons represent almost 90% of Earth’s history.

There are a few simple rules for doing this. But caution must be taken, as there may be situations in which the rules are not valid, so local factors must be understood before an interpretation can be made. These situations are generally rare, but they should not be forgotten when unraveling the geological history of an area.</p> <p>The <strong>principle of superposition</strong> states that sedimentary layers are deposited in sequence, and the layers at the bottom are older than those at the top. This situation may not be true, though, if the sequence of rocks has been flipped completely over by tectonic processes, or disrupted by faulting.</p> <p>The <strong>principle of original horizontality</strong> indicates that sediments are originally deposited as horizontal to nearly horizontal sheets. At a broad scale this is true, but at a smaller scale it may not be. For example, cross-bedding forms at an appreciable angle, where sand is deposited upon the lee face of a ripple. The same holds true of delta foreset beds (Figure 19.6).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2984" style="width: 650px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2984" rel="attachment wp-att-2984"><img class="wp-image-2984" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_-1024x572.png" alt="" width="650" height="363" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_-1024x572.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_-300x168.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_-768x429.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_-65x36.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_-225x126.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_-350x196.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/1280px-Delta_Formation.svg_.png 1280w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.6</strong> A cross-section through a river delta forming in a lake.

But sediments can also terminate against faults or erosional features (see unconformities below), so may be cut off by local factors.</p> <p>The <strong>principle of inclusions</strong> states that any rock fragments that are included in a rock must be older than the rock in which they are included. For example, a <strong>xenolith</strong> in an igneous rock, or a clast in sedimentary rock must be older than the rock that includes it (Figure 19.7). A possible situation that would violate this principle is the following: an igneous dyke may intrude through a sequence of rocks, hence is younger than these rocks (see the principle of cross-cutting relationships below). Later deformation may cause the dyke to be pulled apart into small pieces, surrounded by the host rocks. This situation can make the pieces of the dyke appear to be xenoliths, but they are <em>younger</em> than the surrounding rock in this case.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2986" style="width: 664px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=2986" rel="attachment wp-att-2986"><img class="wp-image-2986" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/principle_of_inclusions.png" alt="" width="664" height="235" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/principle_of_inclusions.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/principle_of_inclusions-300x106.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/principle_of_inclusions-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/principle_of_inclusions-225x80.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/principle_of_inclusions-350x124.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.7</strong> Applications of the principle of inclusion.

An example of this is given in Figure 19.8, which shows three different sedimentary layers. The lower sandstone layer is disrupted by two <strong>faults</strong>, so we can infer that the faults are younger than this layer. But the faults do not appear to continue into the coal seam, and they certainly do not continue into the upper sandstone. So we can infer that coal seam is younger than the faults (because the coal seam cuts across them). The upper sandstone is youngest of all, because it lies on top of the coal seam. An example that violates this principle can be seen with a type of fault called a growth fault. A growth fault is a fault that continues to move as sediments are continuously delivered to the hangingwall block. In this case, the lower portion of the fault that cuts the lower sediments may have originally formed <em>before</em> the uppermost sediments were deposited, despite the fault cutting through all of the sediments, and appearing to be entirely younger than all of the sediments.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_652" style="width: 692px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo.png"><img class="wp-image-652" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-1024x364.png" alt="" width="692" height="246" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-1024x364.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-300x107.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-768x273.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-65x23.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-225x80.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-350x124.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Cretaceous-Nanaimo.png 1414w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.8</strong> Superposition and cross-cutting relationships in Cretaceous Nanaimo Group rocks in Nanaimo BC.

Hence the presence of a baked contact indicates the intrusion is younger than the rocks around it. If an intrusive igneous rock is exposed via erosion, then later buried by sediments, the surrounding rocks will <em>not</em> be baked, as the intrusion was already cold at the time of sediment deposition. But baked contacts may be difficult to discern, or may be minimally developed to absent when the intrusive rocks are low in volume or felsic (relatively cool) in composition.</p> <p>The <strong>principle of chilled margins</strong> states that the portion of an intrusion that has cooled and crystallized next to cold surrounding rock will form smaller crystals than the portion of the intrusion that cooled more slowly deeper in the instrusion, which will form larger crystals. Smaller crystals generally appear darker in colour than larger crystals, so a chilled margin appears as a darkening of the intrusive rock towards the surrounding rock. This principle can be used to distinguish between an igneous sill, which will have a chilled margin at top and bottom, and a subaerial lava flow, which will have a chilled margin only at the bottom.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercise: Cross-Cutting Relationships</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>The outcrop in Figure 19.9 has three main rock types:</p> <ol><li>Buff/pink felsic intrusive igneous rock present as somewhat irregular masses trending from lower right to upper left</li> <li>Dark grey metamorphosed basalt</li> <li>A 50 cm wide light-grey felsic intrusive igneous dyke extending from the lower left to the upper right – offset in several places</li> </ol> <p>Using the principle of cross-cutting relationships outlined above, determine the relative ages of these three rock types.</p> <p>Note: The near-vertical stripes are blasting drill holes.

Recognizing unconformities is important for understanding time relationships in sedimentary sequences. An unconformity is visible in the Grand Canyon (Figure 19.10, white dashed line) above Proterozoic rocks that were tilted and then eroded to a flat surface prior to deposition of the younger Paleozoic rocks. The difference in time between the youngest of the Proterozoic rocks and the oldest of the Paleozoic rocks is nearly 300 million years. Tilting and erosion of the older rocks took place during this time, and if there were any deposition occurring in this area during this time, erosion removed those sediments.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2993" style="width: 605px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Grand-Canyon-unconformity.png"><img class="wp-image-2993" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Grand-Canyon-unconformity.png" alt="" width="605" height="457" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Grand-Canyon-unconformity.png 720w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Grand-Canyon-unconformity-300x227.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Grand-Canyon-unconformity-65x49.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Grand-Canyon-unconformity-225x170.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Grand-Canyon-unconformity-350x264.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>19.10</strong> Angular unconformity in the Grand Canyon in Arizona, with a sketch of rock orientations.

They help us to understand evolution, and life in general; they provide critical information for understanding depositional environments and changes in Earth’s climate; and they can be used to date rocks.</p> <p>Although the recognition of fossils goes back hundreds of years, the systematic cataloguing and assignment of relative ages to different organisms from the distant past—paleontology—only dates back to the earliest part of the 19th century. The oldest undisputed fossils are from rocks dated ~3.5 Ga, and although fossils this old are typically poorly preserved and are not useful for dating rocks, they can still provide important information about conditions at the time. The oldest well-understood fossils are from rocks dating back to ~600 Ma, and the sedimentary record from this time forward is rich in fossil remains that provide a detailed record of the history of life. However, as anyone who has gone hunting for fossils knows, this does not mean that all sedimentary rocks have visible fossils or that they are easy to find. Fossils alone cannot provide us with numerical ages of rocks, but over the past century geologists have acquired enough isotopic dates from rocks associated with fossiliferous rocks (such as igneous dykes cutting through sedimentary layers) to be able to put specific time limits on most fossils.</p> <p>A selective history of life on Earth over the past 600 million years is provided in Figure 19.13. The major groups of organisms that we are familiar with appeared between the late Proterozoic and the Cambrian (~600 Ma to ~541 Ma). Plants, which originally evolved in the oceans as green algae, invaded land during the Ordovician (~450 Ma). Insects, which evolved from marine arthropods, invaded land during the Devonian (400 Ma), and amphibians (i.e., vertebrates) invaded land about 50 million years later. By the late Carboniferous, trees had evolved from earlier plants, and reptiles had evolved from amphibians. By the mid-Triassic, dinosaurs and mammals had evolved from reptiles and reptile ancestors, Birds evolved from dinosaurs during the Jurassic. Flowering plants evolved in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous. The earliest primates evolved from other mammals in the early Paleogene, and the genus <em>Homo </em>evolved during the late Neogene (~2.8 Ma).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_3008" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-3008" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped-1024x339.png" alt="" width="1024" height="339" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped-1024x339.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped-300x99.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped-768x254.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped-65x22.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped-225x74.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Earth-history_cropped-350x116.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.13</strong> A selective summary of life on Earth during the late Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic.

This is William Smith’s <strong>principle of faunal succession</strong>, although in spite of the name, it can apply to fossils of plants and simple organisms as well as to fauna (animals).</p> <p>The Phanerozoic Eon has witnessed five major extinctions (stars in Figure 19.13). The most significant of these was at the end of the Permian, which saw the extinction of over 80% of all species, and over 90% of all marine species. Most well-known types of organisms that survived were still severely impacted by this event. The second most significant extinction occurred at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (K-Pg, also known the Cretaceous-Tertiary or K-T extinction). At that time, ~75% of marine species disappeared, as well as dinosaurs (but not birds) and pterosaurs. Other species were badly reduced but survived, and then flourished in the Paleogene. The K-Pg extinction may have been caused by the impact of a large asteroid (10 km to 15 km in diameter) and/or volcanic eruptions associated with the formation of the Deccan Traps, but it is generally agreed that the other four Phanerozoic mass extinctions had other causes, although their exact nature is not clearly understood.</p> <p>It is not a coincidence that the major extinctions all coincide with boundaries of geological periods and/or eras. Paleontologists have placed most of the divisions of the geological time scale at points in the fossil record where there are major changes in the type of fossils observed.</p> <p>If we can identify a fossil, and we know when the organism lived, we can assign a range of time to the formation of the sediments in which the organism was preserved when it died. This range might be several millions of years, because some organisms survived for a very long time. If the rock we are studying has several types of fossils in it, and we can assign time ranges to all of these fossils, we may be able to narrow the time range for the age of the rock considerably (Figure 19.14).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_658" style="width: 408px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/age-of-a-rock.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-658" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/age-of-a-rock.png" alt="" width="408" height="526" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/age-of-a-rock.png 408w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/age-of-a-rock-233x300.png 233w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/age-of-a-rock-65x84.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/age-of-a-rock-225x290.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/age-of-a-rock-350x451.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.14</strong> Application of bracketing to constrain the age of a rock based on the presence of several fossils.

Sharks, for example, have existed for over 400 million years, and the great white shark has survived for 16 million years so far. Organisms that lived for relatively short time periods are particularly useful for dating rocks, especially if they were distributed over a wide geographic area and hence can be used to compare rocks from different regions. These are known as <strong>index fossils</strong>. There is no specific limit on how short the time span has to be for a fossil to qualify as an index fossil. Some such organisms lived for millions of years, and others for much less than a million years.</p> <p>Some well-studied groups of organisms qualify as <strong>biozone </strong>fossils because, although the genera and families lived over a long time, each species lived for a relatively short time and can be easily distinguished from others on the basis of specific features. For example, ammonites have a distinctive feature known as the <strong>suture</strong> line, where the internal shell layers that separate the individual chambers (<strong>septae</strong>) meet the outer shell wall (Figure 19.15). These suture lines are sufficiently variable to identify species that can be used to estimate the relative or absolute ages of the rocks in which they are found.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_659" style="width: 654px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite.png"><img class="wp-image-659" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite-1024x451.png" alt="" width="654" height="288" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite-1024x451.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite-300x132.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite-768x338.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite-65x29.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite-225x99.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite-350x154.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/septum-of-an-ammonite.png 1300w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.15</strong> The septum of an ammonite (white part, left), and the suture lines where the septae meet the outer shell (right). <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/septum-of-an-ammonite.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p class="NormalOT">Foraminifera—small, calcium carbonate-shelled marine organisms that originated during the Triassic and are still alive today—are also useful biozone fossils.

Correlation seeks to relate the geological history between regions, by relating the rocks in one region to those in another.</p> <p>There are different techniques of correlation. The easiest technique is to correlate by rock type, or lithology, called <strong>lithostratigraphic correlation</strong>. In this method, specific rock types are related between regions. If a sequence of rocks at one site consists of a sandstone unit overlain by a limestone unit, then a unit of shale, and the exact same sequence of rocks—sandstone, limestone, shale—occurs at a nearby site, lithostratigraphic correlation means assuming that the rocks at both sites are in the same rocks. If you could see all of the rock exposed between the two sites, the units would connect with one another. The problem with this type of correlation is that some rocks may only have formed locally, or may pinch out between the two sites, and therefore not be present at the site to which a correlation is being attempted.</p> <p>Another technique, <strong>biostratigraphic correlation</strong>, involves correlation based on fossil content. This technique uses fossil assemblages (fossils of different organisms that occur together) to correlate rocks between regions. The best fossils to use are those that are widely spread, abundant, and lived for a relatively short period of time.</p> <p>Yet another technique, <strong>chronostratigraphic correlation</strong>, is to correlate rocks that have the same age. This can be the most difficult way to correlate, because rocks are generally diachronous. That is, if we trace a given rock unit across any appreciable lateral distance, the age of that rock actually changes. To give a familiar example, when you go to the beach, you know that the beach itself and the lake bottom in the shallow water is sandy. But if you swim out to deeper water and touch bottom, the bottom feels muddy. The difference in sediment type has to do with the energy of deposition, with the waves at and near the beach keeping any fine sediments away, only depositing them in deeper quieter waters. If you think of this example in time, you realize that the sand at and near the beach is being deposited at the same time as the mud in deeper water. But if lake levels drop, the beach sands will slowly migrate outwards and cover some of the deeper water muds. If lake levels rise, the deeper water muds will slowly migrate landwards and cover some of the shallower water sands. This is an example of <strong>Walther&#8217;s Law</strong>, which states that sedimentary rocks that we see one on top of each other in the rock record actually formed adjacent to one another at the time of deposition. In order to correlate rock units in time, we must target marker beds that formed instantaneously. An example of such would be an ash layer from a nearby volcano that erupted and blanketed an entire region in ash. But such marker beds are usually rare to absent, making such correlation extremely difficult.</p> <div><h4>References</h4> <p class="hanging-indent">Harries, P.J., Kauffman, E.G., Crampton, J.S.

It was only in the early part of the 20th century, when isotopic dating methods were first applied, that it became possible to discover the absolute ages of the rocks containing fossils. In most cases, we cannot use isotopic techniques to directly date fossils or the sedimentary rocks in which they are found, but we can constrain their ages by dating igneous rocks that cut across sedimentary rocks, or volcanic ash layers that lie within sedimentary layers.</p> <p>Isotopic dating of rocks, or the minerals within them, is based upon the fact that we know the decay rates of certain unstable <strong>isotopes</strong> of elements, and that these decay rates have been constant throughout geological time. It is also based on the premise that when the atoms of an element decay within a mineral or a rock, they remain trapped in the mineral or rock, and do not escape.</p> <p>One of the isotope pairs commonly used to date rocks is the decay of <sup>40</sup>K to <sup>40</sup>Ar &nbsp;(potassium-40 to argon-40). <sup>40</sup>K is a radioactive isotope of potassium that is present in very small amounts in all minerals that contain potassium. It has a <strong>half-life</strong> of 1.3 billion years, meaning that over a period of 1.3 Ga one-half of the <sup>40</sup>K atoms in a mineral or rock will decay to <sup>40</sup>Ar, and over the next 1.3 Ga one-half of the remaining atoms will decay, and so forth (Figure 19.18). <sup>40</sup>K is called the <strong>parent</strong> <strong>isotope</strong>, and <sup>40</sup>Ar the <strong>daughter isotope</strong>, as the parent gives way to the daughter during radioactive decay.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_663" style="width: 577px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/decay-of-40K.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-663" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/decay-of-40K.png" alt="" width="577" height="436" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/decay-of-40K.png 577w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/decay-of-40K-300x227.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/decay-of-40K-65x49.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/decay-of-40K-225x170.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/decay-of-40K-350x264.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.18</strong> The decay of 40K over time.

One good example is granite, which contains the mineral potassium feldspar (Figure 19.19). Potassium feldspar does not contain any argon when it forms. Over time, the <sup>40</sup>K in the feldspar decays to <sup>40</sup>Ar. The atoms of <sup>40</sup>Ar remain embedded within the crystal, unless the rock is subjected to high temperatures after it forms. The sample must be analyzed using a very sensitive mass-spectrometer, which can detect the differences between the masses of atoms, and can therefore distinguish between <sup>40</sup>K and the much more abundant <sup>39</sup>K. The minerals biotite and hornblende are also commonly used for K-Ar dating.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_664" style="width: 491px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar.jpg"><img class="wp-image-664" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="315" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar.jpg 766w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar-300x192.jpg 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar-65x42.jpg 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar-225x144.jpg 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar-350x224.jpg 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.19</strong> Crystals of potassium feldspar (pink) in a granitic rock are candidates for isotopic dating using the K-Ar method because they contained potassium and no argon when they formed. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>There are many isotope pairs that can be employed in dating igneous and metamorphic rocks (see Table 19.2), each with its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, the daughter isotope <sup>40</sup>Ar is naturally a gas, and can escape the potassium feldspar quite easily if the feldspar is exposed to heating during metamorphism, or interaction with hydrothermal fluids.

If some <sup>40</sup>Ar has been lost, but the sample is dated anyway, an age that is too young will be calculated.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_3016" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/?attachment_id=3016"><img class="wp-image-3016 size-large" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Table_19-2-1024x314.png" alt="" width="1024" height="314" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Table_19-2-1024x314.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Table_19-2-300x92.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Table_19-2-768x236.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Table_19-2-65x20.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Table_19-2-225x69.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Table_19-2-350x107.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Table 19.2</strong> Commonly used isotope systems for dating geological materials. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0. Click the table for a text version.</em></div></div> <p>Each parent isotope has a certain half-life, which ranges from microseconds to billions of years, depending upon the isotope. In dating rocks, we need to select an isotope pair with a parent isotope that has a reasonable half-life. This means that the half-life must not be too short or too long. If the half-life is too short, then most of the parent isotope will have decayed to form the daughter isotope. If we cannot measure the amount of parent isotope very accurately, which will be impossible to do if there is only the tiniest amount of parent isotope left, our calculated age will have huge errors associated with it. The same applies if the half-life is too long. In this case, very little of the daughter isotope will have formed, and our inability to measure the small amount of daughter isotope accurately will again result in huge errors in our calculated age.</p> <p>Another complicating factor is whether the mineral of interest incorporated any of the daughter isotope into its structure at the time of formation. When we select a mineral and an isotope pair to date that mineral, we make the assumption that all of the daughter isotope we find in the mineral was produced in the mineral by radioactive decay of the parent isotope. But if the mineral formed with some daughter isotope already present in its structure, then the age we calculate will be too old.</p> <p>A more robust mineral to use to date certain types of igneous and metamorphic rocks is zircon. Zircon is a mineral that incorporates uranium into its structure at the time of formation. One of the isotopes of uranium decays to lead with a long half-life (see Table 19.2). Zircon is a mineral of choice for dating because it takes no lead into its structure when it forms, so any lead present is due entirely to the radioactive decay of the uranium parent. Another reason is because zircon is a very resistant mineral. It can handle exposure to hydrothermal fluids, and all but the highest grades of metamorphism, and not lose any of the parent or daughter isotopes. Hence the age that we calculate tends to be very accurate. One drawback is that zircon tends to form only in felsic igneous rocks. Hence if we are trying to date a mafic igneous rock, we must choose a different mineral.</p> <h1>The Meaning of a Radiometric Date</h1> <p>When we employ isotopic methods on minerals we are measuring an <strong>age date</strong>. Generally, an age date refers to the time since a mineral crystallized from molten rock (magma or lava). This is when the elements that make up the mineral get locked into the mineral’s structure. But as we have already seen, elevated temperatures can cause elements to escape from a mineral, without the mineral melting. Hence when we date a mineral, we may be dating the time since the mineral crystallized from a melt, <em>or</em> the time since the mineral last experienced a period of heating above its <strong>Curie point</strong>, which is the temperature beyond which the mineral is able to lose (or gain) elements from its structure, without melting. So we have to know something about the rock before we forge ahead to measure an age. We may choose a mineral and isotope pair that are very resistant to metamorphism, so that we can “see through” the metamorphism, and determine the original age that the mineral crystallized from a melt. Or we may be interested in the age of the metamorphic event itself, so choose a mineral and isotope pair that is susceptible to resetting the isotopic clock during metamorphism (such as by losing all of the daughter isotope).</p> <p>Absolute age dating is a powerful tool for unraveling the geological history of a region, but we have seen that we must ultimately rely upon igneous rocks (that may have later metamorphosed) for the minerals that we are able to date (see the next section for issues with dating sedimentary rocks directly). Another issue with absolute age dating is that it is expensive, with a single analysis costing several hundreds of dollars. Hence geologists never forget their relative age dating principles, and are always applying them in the field to determine the sequence of events that formed the rocks in a region.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercise: Combining Absolute Ages with Relative Dating</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>The age dates for three igneous rock layers are given.

If we dated a number of individual grains in the sedimentary rock, we would likely get a range of different dates, all older than the age of the sedimentary rock. The most that such ages gleaned from a sedimentary rock can tell us is a maximum age of the sedimentary rock. It might be possible to date some chemical sedimentary rocks isotopically, but there are no useful isotopes that can be used on old chemical sedimentary rocks.</p> <h1>Radiocarbon Dating</h1> <p>Radiocarbon dating (using <sup>14</sup>C) can be applied to many geological materials, including sediment and sedimentary rocks, but only if the materials in question are younger than ~60 ka, and contain organic material. Beyond this time, there is so little <sup>14</sup>C left that it cannot be measured accurately, and the resulting age dates are hence unreliable. Fragments of wood incorporated into young sediment are good candidates for carbon dating, and this technique has been used widely in studies involving late Pleistocene glaciers and glacial sediments.

The longest such records can take us back over 25 ka, to the height of the last glaciation. One of the advantages of dendrochronology is that, providing reliable reference records are available, the technique can be used to date events to the nearest year.</p> <p>Dendrochronology has been used to date the last major subduction zone earthquake on the coast of B.C., Washington, and Oregon. When large earthquakes occur in this region, there is a tendency for some coastal areas to subside by one or two metres. Seawater then rushes in, flooding coastal flats and killing trees and other vegetation within a few months. There are at least four locations along the coast of Washington that have such dead trees, and probably many more in other areas. Wood samples from these trees have been studied and the ring patterns have been compared with patterns from old living trees in the region (Figure 19.24).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_669" style="width: 639px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating.png"><img class="wp-image-669" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating-1024x321.png" alt="" width="639" height="200" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating-1024x321.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating-300x94.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating-768x241.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating-65x20.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating-225x71.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating-350x110.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/tree-ring-dating.png 1291w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.24</strong> Example of tree-ring dating of dead trees. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/tree-ring-dating.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>At all of the locations studied, the trees were found to have died either in the year 1699, or very shortly thereafter (Figure 19.25).

The magnetic field causes compass needles point toward the north magnetic pole, but this hasn’t always been the case. At various times in the past, Earth’s magnetic field has reversed its polarity, and during such times a compass needle would have pointed to the south magnetic pole. By studying magnetism in volcanic rocks that have been dated isotopically, geologists have been able to establish the chronology of magnetic field reversals going back for ~250 Ma. About 5 Ma of this record is shown in Figure 19.26, where the black bands represent periods of normal magnetism (“normal” meaning a polarity identical to the current magnetic field) and the white bands represent periods of reversed magnetic polarity. These periods of consistent magnetic polarity are given names to make them easier to reference. The current period of normal magnetic polarity, known as Brunhes, has lasted for the past 780,000 years. Prior to that there was a short reversed period and then a short normal period, the latter of which is known as Jaramillo.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_671" style="width: 1024px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-671" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals-1024x273.png" alt="" width="1024" height="273" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals-1024x273.png 1024w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals-300x80.png 300w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals-768x204.png 768w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals-65x17.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals-225x60.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals-350x93.png 350w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/magnetic-field-reversals.png 1307w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.26</strong> The last 5 Ma of magnetic field reversals. <em>Source: Steven Earle (2015) CC BY 4.0 view source, modified after U.S. Geological Survey (2007) Public Domain <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view source</a></em></div></div> <p>Oceanic crust becomes magnetized by the magnetic field that exists as the crust forms from magma at mid-ocean ridges.

By carefully matching the sea-floor magnetic stripes with the known magnetic chronology, we can determine the age at any point on the plate. We can see that the oldest part of the Juan de Fuca Plate that has not yet subducted (off of the coast of Oregon) is just over 8 million years old, while the part that is subducting beneath Vancouver Island is between 0 and ~6 million years old.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_673" style="width: 381px"><a href="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pattern-of-magnetism.png"><img class="wp-image-673" src="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pattern-of-magnetism.png" alt="" width="381" height="501" srcset="https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pattern-of-magnetism.png 650w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pattern-of-magnetism-228x300.png 228w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pattern-of-magnetism-65x85.png 65w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pattern-of-magnetism-225x296.png 225w, https://openpress.usask.ca/app/uploads/sites/29/2017/05/pattern-of-magnetism-350x460.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 19.28</strong> TThe pattern of magnetism within the area of the Juan de Fuca Plate, off the west coast of North America.

The problem is that our lives are short and our memories are even shorter. Our experiences span only a few decades, so we really don’t have a way of knowing what 11,700 years means. What’s more, it is hard for us to understand how 11,700 years differs from 65.5 Ma, or even from 1.8 Ga. It is not that we cannot comprehend what the numbers mean, it is that we cannot really appreciate how much time is involved.</p> <p>You may wonder why it is so important to understand geological time. There are some very good reasons. One is so that we can fully understand how geological processes that seem impossibly slow can produce anything of consequence. Consider driving from one major city to another, where a journey of several hours might occur at speeds of ~100 km/h. Continents move toward each other at rates of a fraction of a millimetre per day, a speed something on the order of 0.00000001 km/h, and yet, at this impossibly slow rate (try walking at this speed!), they can move thousands of kilometres through geological time. Sediments typically accumulate at even slower rates — less than a millimetre per year — but still they are thick enough to be thrust up to form huge mountains or carved into breathtaking canyons.</p> <p>Another reason is to understand issues like extinction of endangered species, and human influence on climate. People who do not understand geological time are quick to say that the climate has changed in the past, and that what is happening now is no different. And climate certainly has changed in the past: from the Eocene (50 Ma) to the present day, Earth’s climate cooled by ~12°C on average. This is a huge change that ranks as one of the most important climate changes of Earth&#8217;s past, and yet the rate of change over this time was only 0.000024 °C/century. Recent warming has occurred at a rate of ~1.1°C over the past 100 years (NASA GISS), 45,800 times faster than the rate of climate change since the Eocene.</p> <p>One way to wrap your mind around geological time is to put it into the perspective of single year. At this rate, each hour of the year is equivalent to approximately 500,000 years, and each day is equivalent to 12.5 million years. If all of geological time is compressed down into a single year, Earth formed on January 1, and the first life forms evolved in late March (~3,500 Ma). The first multicellular life forms appeared on November 13 (~600 Ma), plants appeared on land on November 24, and amphibians on December 3. Reptiles evolved from amphibians during the first week of December, and dinosaurs and early mammals evolved by December 13. Non-avian dinosaurs, which survived for 160 million years, went extinct on Boxing Day (December 26). The Pleistocene glaciation began at ~6:30 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, and the last glacial ice melted from southern Canada by 11:59 p.m.</p> <p>It is worth repeating: on this time scale, the earliest ancestors of the animals and plants with which we are familiar did not appear on Earth until mid-November, the dinosaurs disappeared after Christmas, and most of Canada was periodically locked in ice from 6:30 to 11:59 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. As for people, the first to inhabit Canada arrived about one minute before midnight.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercise: What Happened on Your Birthday?</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>Using the “all of geological time compressed to one year” concept, determine the geological date that is equivalent to your birthday.

The geological timescale is now maintained by the International Commission on Stratigraphy. Geological time is divided into eons, eras, periods, and epochs.</p> <h3>19.2 Relative Dating Methods</h3> <p>We can determine the relative ages of different rocks by observing and interpreting relationships among them, such as superposition, cross-cutting, and inclusions. Gaps in the geological record are represented by various types of unconformities.</p> <h3>19.3 Dating Rocks Using Fossils</h3> <p class="NormalOT">Fossils are useful for dating rocks back to ~600 Ma. If we know the age range of a fossil, we can date the rock in which it is found, but some organisms lived for many millions of years. Index fossils represent shorter geological time spans, and if a rock has several different fossils with known age ranges, we can narrow the time during which the rock formed.</p> <h3>19.4 Isotopic Dating Methods</h3> <p>Radioactive isotopes decay at constant known rates, and can be used to date igneous and metamorphic rocks. Some commonly used isotope systems are potassium-argon, rubidium-strontium, uranium-lead, and carbon-nitrogen. Radiocarbon dating can be applied to sediments and sedimentary rocks, but only if they are younger than 60 ka, and contain organic material, or minerals of calcium carbonate.</p> <h3>19.5 Other Dating Methods</h3> <p>There are many other methods for dating geological materials. Two that are widely used are dendrochronology and magnetic chronology. Dendrochronology, based on studies of tree rings, is widely applied to dating glacial events. Magnetic chronology is based on the known record of Earth’s magnetic field reversals.</p> <h3>19.6 Understanding Geological Time</h3> <p class="NormalOT">While understanding geological time is relatively easy, actually comprehending the significance of the vast amounts of geological time is a great challenge. To be able to solve important geological problems and certain societal challenges, we need to really appreciate the vastness of geological time.</p> <h2>Review Questions</h2> <ol><li>A granitic rock contains inclusions (xenoliths) of basalt. What can you say about the relative ages of the granite and the basalt?</li> <li>Explain the differences between a) disconformity and paraconformity; and b) nonconformity and angular unconformity</li> <li>What are the features of a useful index fossil?</li> <li>Figure 19.29 shows a geological cross-section. The granitic rock F at the bottom is the rock that you estimated the age of in the exercise in 19.4, <em>Radiometric Dating with Potassium-Argon</em>.

(b) A nonconformity is a boundary between sedimentary rocks above and non-sedimentary rocks below while an angular unconformity is a boundary between sedimentary rocks above and tilted and eroded and sedimentary layers below.</li> <li>A useful index fossil must have survived for a relatively short period (e.g., around a million years), and also should have a wide distribution so that it can be used to correlate rocks from different regions.</li> <li>The granitic rock F has been dated to 175 Ma. The wood in layer D is approximately 5,000 years old, so we can assume that layer D is no older than that, although it could be as much as a few hundred years younger if the wood was already old when it got incorporated into the rock.</li> <li>Layer C must be between 5,000 y and 275 Ma.</li> <li>The unconformity between layer C and rock F is a nonconformity.</li> <li>The granite (F) was eroded prior to deposition of C, so it’s likely that layer B was also eroded at the same time. If so, that makes the boundary between C and B a disconformity.</li> <li>The last magnetic reversal was 780,000 years ago, so all rock formed since that time is normally magnetized and it isn’t possible to distinguish older rock from younger rock within that time period using magnetic data.</li> <li>William Smith was familiar with the different diagnostic fossils of the rocks of England and Wales and was able to use them to identify rocks of different ages.</li> <li>The last age of the Cretaceous is the Maastrichtian (71.2 to 66.0 Ma) and the first age of the Paleogene is the Danian (66.0 to 61.6 Ma).</li> </ol> </div></div>
