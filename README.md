_Physical Geology_ is a comprehensive introductory text on the physical aspects of geology, including rocks and minerals, plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, mass wasting, climate change, planetary geology and much more. It has a strong emphasis on examples from western Canada. It is adapted from ["Physical Geology"](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/) written by Steven Earle for the BCcampus Open Textbook Program, and ["Physical Geology, First University of Saskatchewan Edition"](https://openpress.usask.ca/physicalgeology/) by Karla Panchuk. This repository is a **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) adaptation of these projects to facilitate editing and sharing of this amazing project. Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/ for how to compile this source into an actual book (website, PDF, etc.).
